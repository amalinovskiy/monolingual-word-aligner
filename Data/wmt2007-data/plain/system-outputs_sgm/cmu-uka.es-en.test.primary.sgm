I welcome the important speech and substantial by President Prodi.
</seg>
<seg id=6>
You know that this is a deliberate decision which took place in Amsterdam, to distinguish very well the two functions, the High Representative, unlike the Commission, not manifests itself in complete independence, but has the task of coordinating common foreign and security policies which are the responsibility of the Member States and in that case we must make it perhaps a broad scope the intergovernmental aspect.
</seg>
<seg id=7>
He has asked that the Presidency draws Nice in the way for the future.
</seg>
<seg id=8>
Indeed, we want to see more and better, but I think in all honesty that this is a good start.
</seg>
<seg id=9>
Consequently, I trust that the European Council in Nice to be involved with this project and decide starting specifically as a project, not as a fait accompli after having adopted naturally reforms that we now need.
</seg>
<seg id=10>
However, I have also indicated specifically that on the basis of this we can achieve targets extremely important with the Community method we have at present, for example, for better action in the Balkans.

Only if we manage to involve Russia in the West and the European Union, we can influence its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with that country.

Motion for a resolution (B5-0767/00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs on the Charter of Fundamental rights of the European Union

Precisely in order to respond to the expectations of this pensioners who is called Giuseppe Italia and live in Cremona and to which I would like to sail in the Po, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the promotion and development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals.
</seg>
<seg id=15>
- (DE) the result of the vote in this Parliament will be impossible to achieve the objective of the directive, an objective recognised and for which we have already heard all the speakers and the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=16>
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate prior to the vote, because I believe that the risk capital is important.
</seg>
<seg id=17>
My group colleague Armonie Bordes pointed out yesterday way of only a minority has an interest in the transfer of Community money and contributions of occupational pensions to the risks of entrepreneurs.

<seg id=18>
Consequently, the Charter will above all to confirm the current practice, even a step backwards, of nation states, instead of representing progress.
</seg>
<seg id=19>
Mr President, we finally have a Charter of fundamental rights of European citizens which contains an article, Article 25, entirely devoted to the elderly.
</seg>
<seg id=20>
In principle this text may seem anodyne therefore, existing rights, but if we incorporated into the Treaty with binding force, as called for by the European Parliament, in the long term would tend automatically to the harmonization of national legislation in Europe; would give a disproportionate to the Court of Justice; would encourage greater centralisation around the European institutions; would limit the margin decision of each nation.

Progress towards the accession of the 12 candidate countries
</seg>
<seg id=24>
In my opinion, several Member States have not understood until today the existence of this link and the hesitant progress of the Intergovernmental Conference can lead to major difficulties in carrying out enlargement within necessary.
</seg>
<seg id=25>
We can only lead to in practice with lasting nature all the issues I have mentioned until now whether policy and leader of the candidate countries and the European Union - and here I agree with you, Commissioner - made known to the public that the enlargement of the European Union is in itself beneficial.
</seg>
<seg id=26>
This is the formula enshrined.
</seg>
<seg id=27>
Let me mention now the second orientation according to which the presidency wishes to make progress during this six-month period the enlargement process.
</seg>
<seg id=28>
What I propose, therefore, is to work in this direction with the idea that we should examine, within the perspective of the year 2003, what are the candidate could join in that date.
</seg>
<seg id=29>
I thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, on his wide-ranging and explanatory report, as well as the other rapporteurs.
</seg>
<seg id=30>
In these negotiations is not the case no "if..." , but "how" and "cúando" .
</seg>
<seg id=31>
But also been achieved because the prospect of membership of the European Union gives them hope for the solidarity of the European peoples and to do so because they requires solid foundations political and economic.
</seg>
<seg id=32>
Several countries have recorded, as regards the second criterion economic competitiveness in the internal market, progress so great that are very quickly to compliance with the requirements of membership.
</seg>
<seg id=33>
Therefore, we intend to that coordination with the programmes of national governments, Parliament and other institutions is as close as possible.
</seg>
<seg id=34>
In any country of the expected accession with great concern the opinion which sends the Commission annually on its progress, it will be issued again shortly, on 8 November.
</seg>
<seg id=35>
We have chosen rightly the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country will be judged on its own merits.
</seg>
<seg id=36>
This debate represents another opportunity to my political group to emphasise that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and also Cyprus and Malta, is the best guarantee of future for all of us in Europe, in both East and West.
</seg>
<seg id=37>
It is a matter of the utmost importance, and in spite of this, interestingly, has scarcely been public attention.
</seg>
<seg id=38>
People spent jokes by saying that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, enlargement remains to five years' time.
</seg>
<seg id=39>
The next opportunity will be natural in connection with the following elections to the European Parliament of 2009, but we want to endeavour to make the greatest possible number of countries can join as early as the year 2004.
</seg>
<seg id=40>
Moreover, are the six points of substance which we care about the method.
</seg>
<seg id=41>
In fact, we are swimming in the very model of European construction, namely the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity, beyond traditions or the specific characteristics of each other, are happening again in a trap.
</seg>
<seg id=42>
Your words have the support of the President of the Central Bank Hungarian: "the European Union must give the appropriate signals" , otherwise, Eastern Europe sospechará that Europe does not work seriously on enlargement, something which could lead to a dangerous disillusionment on promises in Brussels - I quote the Hungarian spokesman.
</seg>
<seg id=43>
But things must be clear: there can be no accession on the cheap.
</seg>
<seg id=44>
This is an idea that force is also a great idea: we do not enlargements against the opinion, and the best way to make the enlargement with the opinion is its participation in elections, since the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of citizens' support for the political system.
</seg>
<seg id=45>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something briefly about the conditions of the desired scenario here by several parties.
</seg>
<seg id=46>
I would be very surprised if they were not this pressure.
</seg>
<seg id=47>
But I have already indicated that all countries are relatively quickly to the readiness for accession.
</seg>
<seg id=48>
This means that the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products is already agreed without Poles have the concern that collapses their agriculture.
</seg>
<seg id=49>
It has taken efforts, but, in general, peace and trade have established links stronger between citizens, now even more solid with monetary union.
</seg>
<seg id=50>
What counts must be the outcome of the negotiations.
</seg>
<seg id=51>
The only amendment has been tabled is already covered in my report, but I am delighted that the Green Group wishes to stress the importance of equal treatment for citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=52>
Here is not only a law on public service but also that there are opportunities for young people employees of the administration and proper pay.
</seg>
<seg id=53>
This applies both to Latvia and the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=54>
There are plans to the linking of lita the euro in the second half of 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=55>
Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, it is the biggest and most important, but, as we know, it is also the most problematic countries who are preparing to enter the European Union, so problematic that we hear voices about their possible exclusion from the first group of countries which will be included in the first place.
</seg>
<seg id=56>
Poland, to the eastern countries, the countries that were Communists have done too many unfulfilled promises.
</seg>
<seg id=57>
There is one point that always arises when it comes to the Czech Republic, which is the problem of the Roma.
</seg>
<seg id=58>
Slovakia is not condemned to second group, and it is obvious that I wish to join when they do the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id=59>
At the same time, I would like, finally, to make a comment on internal policy.
</seg>
<seg id=60>
Thirdly, as regards agriculture, the level of productivity is even lower than that in the European Union, it is important to ensure the total opening up of the agricultural market to capital necessary for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and marketing structures, and to improve incomes.
</seg>
<seg id=61>
Bulgaria is waiting with bated breath the time to join the European Union and NATO.
</seg>
<seg id=62>
The acute poverty has been a fundamental problem of Romania since 1990 and with the present government the economy, at last, is giving real signs of improvement.
</seg>
<seg id=63>
I trust that these matters become the priorities of the new Parliament to take office in a fortnight' s time, and the new government.
</seg>
<seg id=64>
But we note also that the definitive solution, just and lasting should fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is neither more nor less than the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=65>
Malta has also institutions stable democratic functioning.
</seg>
<seg id=66>
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.
</seg>
<seg id=67>
Must also apply. European Community law is not only a law in the books, but must also be in the candidate countries a law in action.
</seg>
<seg id=68>
This transformation raises some tough demands on people in the candidate countries ensures but at the same time its future and the future of their children.
</seg>
<seg id=69>
Special attention must be paid - where I agree with the previous speaker - to the border regions.
</seg>
<seg id=70>
In this context, must not be left alone to the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=71>
The candidate countries want to achieve a rapid economic growth, even if this takes place at the expense of a political nature protection previously established.
</seg>
<seg id=72>
We are faced with a traffic single return of bad habits, many of them linked to health.
</seg>
<seg id=73>
Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a European continent strong and united.
</seg>
<seg id=74>
The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which is responsible in the domain of transport and the trans-European networks, is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various Community policies sectoral in favour of a global policy planning.
</seg>
<seg id=75>
But first I would like to make the observation that the transport infrastructure will be of central importance for the success of enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=76>
- (DA) Mr President, I join in the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the largest task facing the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=77>
There has been great pressure on social values traditional in Central and Eastern Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=78>
EL PPE does not want to impinge on the responsibilities of the candidates on the pace of accession, since we cannot give a date for this.
</seg>
<seg id=79>
The second point is the mention of dates.
</seg>
<seg id=80>
There is also another reason.
</seg>
<seg id=81>
Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the EU as a whole depend - and this has shown Denmark - largely to be cut deficits social and democratic European policy.
</seg>
<seg id=82>
Populism is epithet The the technocrats the attributed to the will of the people when it is expressed in a way that they should be.
</seg>
<seg id=83>
Ladies and gentlemen, have a pause to eat and rest. we will continue at 21.00 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=84>
In a more long-term perspective, we will have a single currency across the continent.
</seg>
<seg id=85>
On these issues focus battles internal in each country.
</seg>
<seg id=86>
We call on fighting for a different Europe, of all the peoples, which has been got rid of all such inhumane, in which the people are masters of their fate, develop relations of peace, freedom, fraternity, cooperation in of.
</seg>
<seg id=87>
I have publicly praised the work of these organisations and, in particular, of the Romanian challenge appeal which is based in Birmingham and other organisations Irish supported by many people, including Daniel o Donnell artist, varieties of that promised a million pounds and recaudó that amount in Ireland and other parts of the world.
</seg>
<seg id=88>
The Nice Summit must above all provide clarity about whether and how will act the EU on its part to be in a position itself to enlarge in depth and in time.
</seg>
<seg id=89>
The Poles are wondering: are we will pay when we adhiramos or will we be second-class countries?
</seg>
<seg id=90>
I am sure that, with goodwill and with the help of the European Union, we can find a solution which would enable the two communities live in harmony and prosper as they have done for centuries.
</seg>
<seg id=91>
But we have also dealt with the issue of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including the linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.
</seg>
<seg id=92>
The requirement for membership is basically the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.
</seg>
<seg id=93>
We heard about the benefits of enlargement, and this is one of the areas where Lithuania shows us the way.
</seg>
<seg id=94>
Imagine if all we like them!
</seg>
<seg id=95>
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but, first of all, I should like to confine myself to Slovakia, more specifically, to the political situation of minorities.
</seg>
<seg id=96>
I urge you to ensure that in Nice determine a date when to provide conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries more advanced - without mentioning names.
</seg>
<seg id=97>
The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress for the entry into the Union and, of course, making the planning of this aid even more decentralised.
</seg>
<seg id=98>
The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and Parliament in this respect plays an important role and, as we have seen, also positive.
</seg>
<seg id=99>
We are finishing with the division of Europe into two, and not creating a new division.
</seg>
<seg id=100>
All this is contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and congratulate him very sincerely on behalf of our group for this report.
</seg>
<seg id=101>
From this point of view, I believe that the issue of Cyprus is the most will determine Europe' s ability to see its characteristics policies.
</seg>
<seg id=102>
Live near the Baltic Sea, whose situation concerns us all.
</seg>
<seg id=103>
The political vision remains the same.
</seg>
<seg id=104>
That is why I was very nice to hear Mr Klaus Hänsch, who spoke on behalf of the PSE Group, when he wanted the Commission to make a real judgment on the consequences of enlargement, and also on the economic impact that would ensue if it did not take place enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=105>
However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that without transitional periods cannot operate in the interests of both parties. precisely as an MEP of a border region which, like Mrs Schierhuber, has a farm agricultural near the Czech border, it gives me very important arising areas common economic more approximate without any major problems and that lead to positive results on both sides.
</seg>
<seg id=106>
I would like to stress three aspects such as social democrats.
</seg>
<seg id=107>
The EEA, in which are included issues under the first pillar, will allow access of the economies of the candidate countries to the internal market and will give young people and science the right to participate in exchange programmes, but, on the other hand, will not force the EU to widen its system of agricultural subsidies to these countries. in this way, the EEA Agreement would give a positive impetus, primarily, to the economies of the candidate countries - very needy growth to make their societies in a position to join - but also to the national economies of the EU, since it is estimated that, through the economic growth, we could cover even two thirds of the total costs of enlargement, and perhaps even more if we went to the model of the EEA.
</seg>
<seg id=108>
Secondly, let us say no to the idea of big-bang which consists of accepting a large group of candidate countries simultaneously, because that would run counter to the principle that the countries are accepted on its own merits.
</seg>
<seg id=109>
Thirdly, we must do everything in our power to prepare until 2003 to the European Union for the enlargement process within the meaning of the excellent speech by the President of the Commission Prodi.
</seg>
<seg id=110>
In this context, I would like to refer to the relationship between Parliament and the Council and point out that recently the Council responds with a great deal of ground to written questions of Members.
</seg>
<seg id=111>
It is worrying that this is happening in a country that is going to join the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=112>
Request for its preparation.
</seg>
<seg id=113>
- (SV) Mr President, today we are going to discuss and perhaps we will vote on three reports dealing with this matter, two of whom are mine.
</seg>
<seg id=114>
All those involved in the food chain will benefit.
</seg>
<seg id=115>
The safe food have a cost throughout the chain.
</seg>
<seg id=116>
We must therefore support Mrs Paulsen and the Commission, and adopt the principle of no-disolución, to give certainty to animal feed and protect really to European consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=117>
The 1999 directive is a text thoughtful and can now show some success, since we have managed to reduce demonstrable damage the burden.
</seg>
<seg id=118>
But simply accept the possibility of "dilute" products is not the solution.
</seg>
<seg id=119>
Very quickly, that we must insist on amendment No 37 on dioxin.
</seg>
<seg id=120>
On this point, we agree.
</seg>
<seg id=121>
Therefore, the result is that, as European consumers, we will have to continue buying meat and milk and blood products produced in world markets with feed which bear any relation to the thresholds and the limit values which have established as a European Union, and with a system of production of animal feed which is raw materials on the international markets, free of any mixing principle and formulation before marketing their products in the territory of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=122>
Before the second reading, we need to know the Commission' s view on how will be the assessment of the risk factors.
</seg>
<seg id=123>
On the contrary, it would be unfortunate if they were adopted, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40, since that would mean that would disappear the option for Member States to intervene promptly towards the new dangers that are discovered.
</seg>
<seg id=124>
Consumer protection begins with animal feed, for the content of feedingstuffs, your statement and, finally, its administrative control.
</seg>
<seg id=125>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition deals with an important subject, as all the important issues, raises many discrepancies.
</seg>
<seg id=126>
Mr President, the discussion on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen nuances had very emotional in a number of points, and I believe that, once completed this debate, we must assume that the required the industry fodder for cattle are certainly strict but then we can do that quality is amended adding components.
</seg>
<seg id=127>
These three proposals address, individually and collectively, the serious shortcomings that the dioxin crisis has brought to light.
</seg>
<seg id=128>
Amendment No 33 deletes the possibility of re-exporting the country of origin appropriations not permissible.
</seg>
<seg id=129>
Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which propose introducing the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of raw materials for contaminated feed, are also unacceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=130>
That should suffice, bearing in mind our commitment to establish a rapid alert system covering the whole food chain and animal feed in the new proposal on the food authority.
</seg>
<seg id=131>
Commissioner Byrne, following this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs lies essentially an old problem, namely, the open declaration.
</seg>
<seg id=132>
This is already a profit that has brought me this morning' s sitting.
</seg>
<seg id=133>
If we do so, if we transponemos quickly and also if if if the codecision procedure, no doubt we will have gained a lot, and I am sure that we will be able to stand very firm and unanimous before the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=134>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too can happen again or at least it cannot be ruled out that in feedingstuffs are introduced raw materials polluted.
</seg>
<seg id=135>
The BSE scandal was the worst example and better known.
</seg>
<seg id=136>
Common sense, as our rapporteur has said - would obviously be a label be open, to present the list of ingredients.
</seg>
<seg id=137>
I believe that the technical qualifications and competence of the members of the Committee on Agriculture to judge on issues relating to agriculture and also with animal feed is indisputable from the point of view of the search for a solution with a practical guidance and practicable, farmers and consumers concerned can implement and understand.
</seg>
<seg id=138>
So much for the positive side.
</seg>
<seg id=139>
In my view, is a legitimate right to information must be satisfied.
</seg>
<seg id=140>
I would ask, Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send the Parliament' s condolences to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Britain and Marín, Galicia, where they are most of the victims.
</seg>
<seg id=141>
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
</seg>
<seg id=142>
Is anyone opposed to the tabling of this oral amendment?
</seg>
<seg id=143>
That is precisely how the rapporteur explained things.
</seg>
<seg id=144>
The majority of its technical proposals deserve to be supported enthusiastically, for example those relating to food safety, the decommissioning of nuclear power plants first generation, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping, essential to the code of conduct for companies in the West when working in the East, etc. the task is enormous, and also absolute priority.
</seg>
<seg id=145>
At the same time, barriers to overcome are considerable, especially at the level of the budget.
</seg>
<seg id=146>
Enlargement to thirteen countries not only change the geopolitical context of the European Union, but also change its structure, because the total population will increase + (28%), but at the same time it will be the number of "less-favoured regions" .
</seg>
<seg id=147>
In this context, we must bear in mind that, because of its strong economic weight and social a agriculture and food industry competitive will have a decisive importance to the success of the process of transformation and restructuring of the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=148>
In this respect, I would like to see the outermost regions, including 6 out of every 7 are still in the group of the 10 poorest EU benefited from the Structural Funds, not only on the basis of single criterion of GDP, but also on the basis of geographical indicators, demographic and above all social.
</seg>
<seg id=149>
As we reject, for the sake of the French, we cannot, in all conscience, accept its extension to the countries and peoples to the east, hardly released from the communist dictatorship, which cannot yet know the trap technocratic and totalitarian in wishing to fall.
</seg>
<seg id=150>
We should have content ourselves with national reports and, as far as possible, a resolution brief, but full of content.
</seg>
<seg id=151>
The current system, with subsidies, grants and quotas must be replaced by free trade and the adaptation to the markets.
</seg>
<seg id=152>
The importance and the extent of the problems arising from enlargement are incompatible with the double language on which it has been used within the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=153>
For me to speak enlargement does not recognise the party or non-party of some countries to Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=154>
Our neighbouring country has worked with determination over the last ten years in order to comply with the criteria of accession.
</seg>
<seg id=155>
Latvia has its place in this Chamber, not only because overall, its progress give you the right to this "confidence" essential to complete successfully negotiations of this kind, but, above all, and above all, because in Europe is at home.
</seg>
<seg id=156>
Gawronski with this report, and I believe that Poland is the rule, among all those who have applied for membership, which deserves more than others our support, given that, without the very important initiatives of Poland, would not have fallen communism and today we would be talking here about this problem.
</seg>
<seg id=157>
This may not be so obvious to the population, which remains largely eurosceptic.
</seg>
<seg id=158>
I urge you to Prague to welcome this signal, this request, this request to establish a dialogue and, to reply to him and ensure, together with this House, to make it possible to overcome the legacy of a nationalist was.

<seg id=159>
I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia' s application for membership of the European Union and I agree with most of the conclusions reached by the rapporteur.
</seg>
<seg id=160>
I am pleased to take this opportunity to send a I welcome in particular the elderly and pensioners of the Bulgarian Republic. as stated in the report by Mr.

<seg id=161>
If Romania is still the European Union and adapted its institutional structure and its policies in order to cope with enlargement, I see no reason why that Romania should not be admitted to the Union.

Whatever solution is to be taken with regard to the settlers, and it is one of the difficult issues, together with the return of land on both sides, this is too harsh, if we do not do some qualification.

Unfortunately, some of the points that the Committee on foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy discharged in the draft report on Cyprus' s membership application to the European Union does not make matters easier.

Some important aspects of the regulation are: firstly, the regulation of the burden of proof.

<seg id=172>
Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.

<seg id=173>
That is why we need legislation against discrimination.

<seg id=174>
Partly as a result, we have before us a great deal of amendments legal and technical aspiring to ensure a level of equal treatment against discrimination on grounds of race, on the one hand, and on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation, on the other hand.
</seg>
<seg id=175>
We had to make an effort to balance, moderation and good legal technique and his report reflects, in my view, these qualities.
</seg>
<seg id=176>
I also believe that the cases of discrimination are not as many as to merit legislation.
</seg>
<seg id=177>
In the action programme there are not enough funds to replace this work taking place in the fifth framework programme and, hopefully, will be followed up in all the other framework programmes, although we must ensure that are compatible.
</seg>
<seg id=178>
We all agree that we must fight against discrimination, but opinions vary on how to do it, to what extent and at what methods.
</seg>
<seg id=179>
I was able, in committee, indignarme against the fact that experts could also be outside NGOs and yet have things to say.
</seg>
<seg id=180>
We are also very satisfied with the provisions of the directive that makes it clear that equal treatment for disabled also means also expected of companies to make adjustments in the workplace.
</seg>
<seg id=181>
Only then will we see effectively combating discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=182>
After all, as we learn from the great democracies, anglosajonas racism and discrimination are fought by liberal democracy and not with the restriction or the gradual erosion of freedom of expression and freedom of expression, association and economic.
</seg>
<seg id=183>
We have a proposal which brings homosexuality in the same category as the Holy marriage.
</seg>
<seg id=184>
Strengthening the positions of the European Union to specific situations suffered by its inhabitants with regard to discrimination and equal treatment.
</seg>
<seg id=185>
I would also like to comment on the issue of exclusion religion.
</seg>
<seg id=186>
There are those who I expressed concern about the possible interpretation of the recitals relating to Article 1 that, once again, may seem unclear, but make a distinction between sexual orientation and behaviour.
</seg>
<seg id=187>
So there is hierarchy in discrimination.
</seg>
<seg id=188>
In New Caledonia preference is given on basis a a a skin.
</seg>
<seg id=189>
The first positive element of the directive is the universal approach in which we conceive the treatment of discrimination, which is of particular importance if you want to have a proper implementation of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=190>
So those who come here to say that Europe must not collect in a directive values which we all want to defend, confusing.
</seg>
<seg id=191>
We should not interfere in these achievements we reached with so many efforts.
</seg>
<seg id=192>
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task.
</seg>
<seg id=193>
Experience has taught us that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.
</seg>
<seg id=194>
We must avoid red tape absurd, that the only thing that will manage to reduce Europe to entity a a a politically correct, but meaningless.
</seg>
<seg id=195>
I believe that this Parliament embellished as if it were a Christmas tree the little advanced legislation that the Commission would have liked to put on the table.
</seg>
<seg id=196>
I would like to start by thanking both rapporteurs, Messrs Mann and Cashman, this excellent report.
</seg>
<seg id=197>
I will accept the amendments which seek to highlight the importance of preventing and combating discrimination.
</seg>
<seg id=198>
The second category is intended to clarify the text of the Commission' s proposal and the third covers a large number of amendments which seek to adapt this proposal to the directive on race, adopted last June.
</seg>
<seg id=199>
In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose deleting the reference to discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic.
</seg>
<seg id=200>
I cannot accept the references made by Parliament in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to the natural and legal persons, as well as the unofficial groupings, because this proposal on employment applies only to individuals.
</seg>
<seg id=201>
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=202>
We cannot expect a public support operations of establishing peace, if our troops are exposed to die as a result of shells from weapons that we ourselves have supplied.
</seg>
<seg id=203>
In my own country, to own a escopeta needs a licence, but not for instalarme as seller of weapons in a cobertizo of my garden.
</seg>
<seg id=204>
Another important point is the ban on the export promotion and marketing of equipment and know-how used to inflict torture.
</seg>
<seg id=205>
Having said that, I would naturally like to congratulate Mr Titley on his excellent report.
</seg>
<seg id=206>
We must extend our examination, on the one hand, in addition to the issues of legally binding, also other aspects outside equipment for strict military use, such as the disarmament and to increase the effectiveness of the body of police and customs authorities, and then, on the other hand, to candidate countries, as has just been mentioned by Mr Wiersma.

With regard to the problems of SMEs, of course, that, in the framework programme, SMEs have their part as planned in the budgetary decision.
</seg>

This is at least what appears to colegirse the debate on the budget in Greece; and the fact is that many invoke the views of the European Union. is that true?
</seg>
<seg id=214>
As regards the pluridisciplinaridad, I share your opinion.

On the one hand, and after the effort made to fully commit funds at the end of 1999, requests in body at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects were necessarily very small.
</seg>
<seg id=219>
But I repeat that Portugal did well in the previous period, but what I would simply like to point out, and I would like the figures for 26 September, is that the funds actually committed by Portugal and for the new period (I am only commissioner for a year) reach 2.6%.

Finally, the establishment of a high level of contributions from uses and consumption on hydrocarbons does not lead to a no-cumplimiento of Community provisions on competition.

Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, in cases where the Member States promote by means tax specific sector of industry, infringe the rules on state aid, in this case fiscal aid state, which amounts to a subsidy.

For example, nuclear energy is a case very clear and timely.

Mr President, the Members of this House I am sure you know that the Structural Funds - and this is a novelty - spend a lot of resources for cultural activities, because I insisted, Michel Barnier, in which they are not only invest in roads and airports, but also in people.
</seg>
<seg id=226>
So that next year the Commission does not intend to formulate new financial commitments in this regard.
</seg>
<seg id=227>
In relation to the specific financial proposal, I cannot adopt a position, because we must respect the normal procedures.
</seg>
<seg id=228>
- (SV) I thought in many alternatives.
</seg>
<seg id=229>
And it is a reality which we must face, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.

Do the rules governing the treatment of products hunting, for example the elk, also apply to meat used for consumption itself?

<seg id=240>
Elections are an important step for the people of Kosovo to be involved in the administration of their communities.
</seg>
<seg id=241>
I can tell you that the development of these elections has been more democratic, better than the elections in our own countries, in which on many occasions I have participated or I was an observer.

<seg id=242>
But what we saw as a principle and not in any way, as the end of the process.

Although these institutions must have the option to appoint an internal auditor, it is enough to impose certain minimum requirements audit the financial controller.
</seg>
<seg id=248>
This proposal does not have the unanimous approval of this Parliament as well knows the Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=249>
Therefore, we have no objection to creating an internal audit service independent, to which today we give the green light to the report by Mr van Hulten.
</seg>
<seg id=250>
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur.
</seg>
<seg id=251>
Modernising the administration is urgently needed in our view.
</seg>
<seg id=252>
An independent audit is essential to avoid mistakes.
</seg>
<seg id=253>
The money must be spent in the future way of objectives and more effective, and, of course, be better guarantee funds are used for the purpose for which the allocated the budgetary authority.
</seg>
<seg id=254>
As regards the proposed amendments, I should like to state very briefly: the Commission accepts the introduction of additional recital.
</seg>
<seg id=255>
That is why I should like to thank you for your suggestions and your advice.
</seg>
<seg id=256>
I would like to summarise the proposals in this report which I think are most important and viable specifically: firstly, the creation of a group of experts composed of personalities of recognised standing, appointed by the Member States, to help establish parameters minimum protection of minors; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation between all operators in the sector; third, the possibility of promoting and become accessible systems filter both for television and for the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id=257>
Unfortunately, I cannot subscribe to requests from the Liberals.
</seg>
<seg id=258>
This remains essentially the responsibility of the Member States' legislation, which does not exclude, however, the possibility of a consensual agreement at European level on certain indicative values, through dialogue with all the parties involved.
</seg>
<seg id=259>
However, and equal other circumstances, I think that it is up to parents dissuade their children to see that this type of programme at home.
</seg>
<seg id=260>
Parents need special support in this area, which must include the following: common parameters for the media protection of minors throughout the territory of the European Union; the installation and the possibility of having filter systems at affordable prices; legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, companies and providers of public and private sectors.
</seg>
<seg id=261>
Then I am surprised, and this is a euphemism, to hear some say, during discussions in committee, all the evidence harmful influence which may have, on children, the television violence in all its forms.
</seg>
<seg id=262>
With regard to the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it should be noted, particularly from a technical point of view, that in certain Member States broadcasters have already introduced codes of adjustment for televisions which should enable parents cut off the flow.
</seg>
<seg id=263>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=264>
In particular, my report replaces the valuable international generalisations for a referral back, in fact, decisions to the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=265>
This would be the least to give us this area of freedom which is a fundamental right of every citizen of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=266>
There are still things, Mr President, that have not been paid since 1996.
</seg>
<seg id=267>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mantovani, the work carried out.
</seg>
<seg id=268>
I would recommend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.
</seg>
<seg id=269>
Our human resources are our future only in a world where knowledge is what counts.
</seg>
<seg id=270>
Will not solve the problems green papers, white, or black soft, but with concrete action.
</seg>
<seg id=271>
But the European Parliament, and it is its role, Parliament pressed for researchers were despite everything included in the text.
</seg>
<seg id=272>
Today we visit at a crucial time for the future of European integration.
</seg>
<seg id=273>
However, we know that the process is not complete and that their inconclusión threatens their vitality.
</seg>
<seg id=274>
If we do not say now, at this delicate and tumultuosa stage of European and world history, when can we?
</seg>
<seg id=275>
None of us can pretend now know exactly when and how sequence we will achieve these objectives, but we all know that believe in them and deseándolos fervently hope, we will go the halfway stage.
</seg>
<seg id=276>
We must ensure that women can benefit from the work induced while prevent the recurrence the same inequalities in the more traditional industries: less specialized jobs, part-time sometimes not elected contracts, insecure and difficulty of access to the managerial positions.
</seg>
<seg id=277>
Will be presented to the Council a proposal for indicators which will enable us to gauge the progress made in this respect.
</seg>
<seg id=278>
Finally, in a nutshell, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reaffirms the integrated approach of equality with gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.
</seg>
<seg id=279>
I think in particular of the violence suffered by them, one of the priority issues of my government action and also mobilises in particular - I know - to you.
</seg>
<seg id=280>
We know that measures to reconcile family and professional life encourage particularly women, although still missing studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women play in it, which is no longer the traditional, since society has changed a great deal and, at the same time, the family structure.
</seg>
<seg id=281>
Sometimes, even colleagues in this Parliament believe that there are, but this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id=282>
I should like to conclude by saying that equal opportunities begins at home.
</seg>
<seg id=283>
This position seems to me embarrassing and ambiguous and deserves, I believe, Reflection for projects proposed, because it is not certain that with all this desemboquemos in practice.
</seg>
<seg id=284>
In this area there is no equality.
</seg>
<seg id=285>
The image of the European woman, who discovered over the pages of our report, our directives, does not square with these women Danish opponents mostly to the euro.
</seg>
<seg id=286>
In this respect, I think it significant that the report insists on having to strike a balance numerical in all sectors of society, for example in the labour market.
</seg>
<seg id=287>
That is why it seems to me that an opportunity has been missed in this report because marriage and the family are completely marginalised.
</seg>
<seg id=288>
That is something that should also take account of the Committee on Women' s rights and equal opportunities.
</seg>
<seg id=289>
We have heard that the previous presidency of the first Council Council Council Ministry of Equal Opportunities for their country country country.

Salaries means of women are still below, on average, in almost 28% of men's, which contributes to that women are the majority of the poor population and hinders their participation in social and political life.
</seg>
<seg id=291>
This is excellent.
</seg>
<seg id=292>
We are now seeing in Europe a impoverishment of women employees in France and also, where 15% of them live, at the end of the day, with fewer than 3,650 French francs per month.
</seg>
<seg id=293>
Not all countries have managed to follow his example and I hope that the example of France end growing in other countries.
</seg>
<seg id=294>
Obviously, the history of women is very long.
</seg>
<seg id=295>
We must help really candidates to be at the level of the acquis communautaire.
</seg>
<seg id=296>
But I would need your help.
</seg>
<seg id=297>
It is not the case, but it is a text satisfactory and, on reflection at length and after a wide-ranging debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs chose not to table amendments.
</seg>
<seg id=298>
The Legal Affairs Committee, after a long debate, understood not that which maintain that legal uncertainty for six years, that three years, which is the deadline laid down, it is more reasonable so that, with the appropriate means and a medium-sized diligence, one approach would be to establish whether there has been no or irregularity in a statement.

<seg id=299>
This is amendment No 15, relating to fraud.

The goal of achieving especially communication a a a high-quality with legislation sufficiently flexible, with an improvement procedure of the greater the adaptation of the provisions in the field of customs formalities, responds to one of the requirements of the single market and has been achieved, so much so that even many countries have been based on it in order to be able to participate quickly in international trade.

</seg>
<seg id=302>

Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.
</seg>
<seg id=305>
It is recognised that knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition for mobility.

I regret that a much-needed proposal to introduce a prescription deadline of allowing retain the documentation for a limited period has not obtained a majority of the votes.

<seg id=308>
During the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we welcome the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or philosophical beliefs not sectarian, disability, age or sexual orientation.
</seg>
<seg id=309>
My final point concerns the budget for this programme, namely EUR 98.4 million, a sum which is, of course, inadequate for the actions planned.
</seg>
<seg id=310>
The arguments put forward in this amendment follows explicitly that its purpose is to intervene in the stipulations age of Member States, which are, however, perfectly justified on the grounds of psychological development and have no impact on the working life.
</seg>
<seg id=311>
In my opinion, also needless everything stipulated in the new Article 12 (A).
</seg>
<seg id=312>
With regard to the belief or religion, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=313>
- (SV) the Christian Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive on equality in the workplace.
</seg>
<seg id=314>
But this only says something of the workforce of an internal audit service and nothing of the financial importance and usefulness of this service.

The EU has decided to set up a military capability common to meet the objectives so-called Petersberg (The fight against the crisis and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU) and yet does not have a common defence policy.

</seg>
<seg id=317>
With this resolution does not want to reduce radically arms sales to promote a policy of disarmament, but only regulating them to ensure more of the benefits of industrial groups are concerned.
</seg>
<seg id=318>
The Commission Communication recognises the problem but not proposes concrete measures is because because because the logic of the liberalisation of the market and of competitiveness, and that no proposal concerns the harsh reality, especially for children, the profligacy of multinational companies, which, in their pursuit of profit, ignore the impact of its programmes and products and move the whole responsibility parents, also inviting them to consume new products to protect their children.
</seg>
<seg id=319>
Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures aimed at protecting young people programmes violent and harmful should not be limited to traditional television, but to apply all the media.

Mr President, I hope that instead of having a debate on Latin America during a matter of urgency abordáramos this issue following a discussion well-considered in the committees.

</seg>
<seg id=333>
Unfortunately, all we would not have to return to Colombia.
</seg>
<seg id=334>
The Commission has already shown its willingness to coordinate measures that package. in the next few days intends to allocate substantial resources for this purpose.
</seg>
<seg id=335>
Therefore, once again, apply double standards here, and I believe that we must deplore.
</seg>
<seg id=336>
The attitude adopted by the Albanian opposition I find it incomprehensible, especially since it deliberately refusing to accept a solution essential intended to remedy an Albanian problem in Macedonia.

I think that is something extraordinary that the Macedonians within their country reach agreements with each other.
</seg>
<seg id=338>
However, the government, which has shown an enormous value to find a solution to the problem University and many other issues, needs clear positive signs and strong support, otherwise, the consequences for peace in the area can be harmful.

I would like to point out that already today all the Greek Members of the European Parliament have reacted to this situation.
</seg>
<seg id=341>
As this concerns Greece, which has the greatest maritime sector throughout the European Union, basically concerns the security of the entire navigation in the whole of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=342>
In recent years, in our own waters, have been given many lives at sea, not only in large ferry accidents but also all too often, between our fishing community.

On the contrary, it exploits the innocent victims to promote broader objectives of shipowners.
</seg>
<seg id=344>
We must bear in mind that we are dealing here with the credibility of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=345>
In conclusion I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the problem of the legal provisions European about the safety of passenger ships must be one of the main concerns of the European Union, and that it is a question of ensuring strict application and uniform them throughout the Community.
</seg>
<seg id=346>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry for my somewhat late arrival for reasons which you know well, to make a very brief statement on the two issues that are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade, and in the ex-República of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id=347>
Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as did Mr Solana, on the two issues we are discussing this evening, namely the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
</seg>
<seg id=348>
We must be prepared to meet this promise with regard respect the will of the people.
</seg>
<seg id=349>
Madam President, Mr high Representative, Commissioner, I am participating in this debate with reservations, because I did not want that Parliament apareciese solely as a judge authorised to launch a anathema this or that, at a time when, following the hopes so strongly encouraged here a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id=350>
Madam President, my speech today is not based on a number of analysis distance, but in my own experiences of last week, since by chance, I was in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip occurred when there these disturbances.
</seg>
<seg id=351>
Although I am against any violence, cannot be treated with the same brush violence Israeli and Palestinian violence.
</seg>
<seg id=352>
I would ask Parliament, at this critical moment, to issue a statement of support to the courageous today have stood up for freedom in the streets of Belgrade, echoing the support that we Europeans not so many years ago we give to those in other capital also fighting for their freedom.
</seg>
<seg id=353>
Madam President, the Europeans would certainly very inspired if collected flight to the ball us that that same which the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.

<seg id=354>
The position of Jerusalem is the complex issue in the negotiations.

For years has managed to mislead the people of your country with its propaganda machine and the brutal repression of the media and, unfortunately, has also managed to fob off many people of the Western world by creating a false picture of reality.

<seg id=356>
While the tragedy concludes, it is the duty of this Parliament, as a symbol of the united Europe and free, supporting the masses around the Yugoslav parliament and help to Mr Kostuníca to achieve and play its mandate.
</seg>
<seg id=357>
It is precisely its position so hard makes us fear the worst at the same time - and current events reinforce these phrases that were drafted a few hours ago.
</seg>
<seg id=358>
I wonder whether the Commissioner is already looking at the steps required to make it clear that we regard Kostunica really as the legitimate elected representative of the Serbian people, and as the real partner with whom the European Union wants to speak from today.
</seg>
<seg id=359>
The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity at this historic moment in which tyranny is faltering triumphs and democracy.
</seg>
<seg id=360>
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank loans for projects in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).
</seg>
<seg id=361>
I welcome the new political direction that began in that country, following the legislative and presidential elections.
</seg>
<seg id=362>
Between the Union and Croatia in office, among others, a group of advisers whose mission is to offer Croatia their experience and technical assistance within the framework of negotiations for agreements normalisation of relations.
</seg>
<seg id=363>
Let us not forget that until recently, Croatia was a textbook of a programme of privatisation completely failed, of which only benefited the few. this process should be supported in its entirety.
</seg>
<seg id=364>
The sum of EUR 250 million in the form of a loan from the EIB for the period 2000-2007 which we are debating will not be a milestone, but will help and encouragement.
</seg>
<seg id=365>
It is therefore not entirely right to speak on the report "democratisation" .
</seg>
<seg id=366>
When Croatia and Slovakia managed for the first time a apparent independence, acted as servants of the Hitler regime.
</seg>
<seg id=367>
We could also, of course, have considered the issue of the application and guarantee the Croatian issue in the same context of the debate yesterday evening and the situation in Belgrade.
</seg>
<seg id=368>
When it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed, we trust that actions to establish a partnership and a normal relationship between Serbia and this Union of democracies delay only a few days' time.
</seg>
<seg id=369>
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.
</seg>
<seg id=370>
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
</seg>
<seg id=371>
My question is this: who is entitled to speak on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute?
</seg>
<seg id=372>
I would ask you, Madam President, that you will make every possible effort to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions on a letter of protest who have submitted over thirty collective and social NGOs against this situation, which has been blatantly breached the Community rules on radiation protection.
</seg>
<seg id=373>
The autopsia practised in Georgia has clearly shown that it was a murder with possible torture.
</seg>
<seg id=374>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an opportunity for us to take a major step towards our dream - which, incidentally, I do not share.
</seg>
<seg id=375>
This is the Basic Law and the basis for any other rules on modified plants by genetic technology.
</seg>
<seg id=376>
Of course, is a blunder to another.
</seg>
<seg id=377>
(The sitting was suspended at 17.40 p.m. and resumed at 17.50 p.m.)
</seg>
<seg id=378>
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council (COM(2000) 379 - 0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS), the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the agenda socio-política.
</seg>
<seg id=379>
Thirdly, just one question: to stress the importance of this open method of coordination does not mean that this method will replace social legislation, because we have set of Europe' s social rights, we must have the courage to draw up minimum social standards and it is essential that there should be a social legislation for the internal European market.
</seg>
<seg id=380>
Similarly, in our view we support the social dialogue and cooperation with civil society and especially with women' s associations of the countries which are preparing its annexation to the European family, since there too we must achieve a uniform development to continue the steps and the logic of the rest of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=381>
The spheres of activity listed in the Commission communication are the subject of an overall agreement.
</seg>
<seg id=382>
I remember, at this stage of my speech, to be held in Biarritz a seminar European, which I will chair, on this subject on 4 and 5 December.
</seg>
<seg id=383>
With regard to the fight against the exclusions, we have come a long way to define, on 17 October, in the Council on "employment and social policy" , objectives appropriate to combat poverty and social exclusion, which will form the basis of national action plans.
</seg>
<seg id=384>
I have heard in some quarters that, having read the report, agree with the diagnosis, but not with the formula.
</seg>
<seg id=385>
Technological development and new methods of organisation also speak in favour of a flexible cooperation where concentrate more on objectives and to achieve results and for less rigid regulations.
</seg>
<seg id=386>
We need to find in that direction, in our opinion, the arcaísmo that they are accused those who expect a market without obstacles is the best of all possible worlds.
</seg>
<seg id=387>
Certainly, this has contributed to reducing the discontent among workers in our country and increasing investments in the country from outside.
</seg>
<seg id=388>
On the other hand, the method used seems more questionable.
</seg>
<seg id=389>
If we are talking about a Charter of fundamental rights and looking for a European constitution cannot be estrábicos, but we must say that we have to give all the necessary steps, although this legislation requires more attentive and I do not think that Mrs
</seg>
<seg id=390>
I would like to point out critically the lack of initiatives on new challenges in the workplace protection, the involvement of employees and in labour relations.
</seg>
<seg id=391>
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for this presentation of the social policy agenda.
</seg>
<seg id=392>
As we know, Conservatives are opposed to these points. our group them attaches particular importance.
</seg>
<seg id=393>
The third issue is enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=394>
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=395>
The Commission measures must be complemented by studies on the individual access to health systems and social security systems and pension, about the shortcomings in the work organization and, perhaps, also on the general reduction in working hours.
</seg>
<seg id=396>
In this way, women feel Europe closer, and Europe will gain with the interesting ideas and innovative to express itself through its relationship with this programme.
</seg>
<seg id=397>
We expect an annual report from the President of the Commission within the framework of a debate to be held every year in the European Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=398>
I am pleased also that it is scheduled a better distribution of childcare, in order to facilitate the balance between work and family life.
</seg>
<seg id=399>
My group will take this into account in the final vote.
</seg>
<seg id=400>
(The President cut the speaker off)
</seg>
<seg id=401>
I welcome the new approach of the Commission, and very well thought-out the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme.
</seg>
<seg id=402>
I believe that the large number of amendments adopted shows the common feeling of the European Commission and the Committee on Women' s rights and equal opportunities.
</seg>
<seg id=403>
On the one hand, over the past year I have received several requests of companies that have felt a certain powerlessness following certain decisions on mergers, particularly relating to cases where they had need to appeal to the Commission' s decision before the Court of First Instance.
</seg>
<seg id=404>
I should also like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner Monti on when we can expect to be put in place a public register, effective and efficient state aid, and also on when will become a reality at length the promised table of results.
</seg>
<seg id=405>
I would also like to say to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next report we find a paragraph rather more extensive dedicated to the financial services sector.
</seg>
<seg id=406>
What I said applies not only to the field of energy policy, but also for all the other areas.
</seg>
<seg id=407>
Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work that has been carried out on both reports which give a positive opinion on both your personal work and on the Directorate-General for Competition.
</seg>
<seg id=408>
I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and in this respect should not exist and cannot be unrestricted competition.
</seg>
<seg id=409>
Mr President, today, and, of course, I do not intend to do, that public aid alter the conditions of competition and constitute a harmful element that encourages the inefficiency of companies.
</seg>
<seg id=410>
To hear you deny the fact that public aid have fallen during the period 1994-1998, when the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, has at least been rather odd.
</seg>
<seg id=411>
And, of course, Mr President, although my opinion relates to XXIX Commission Report on Competition Policy, we cannot currently stop looking to the past, but nothing more than to learn for the future.
</seg>
<seg id=412>
Mr President, during the time available to me, I would like to address three points: the modernisation of Community law on competition, the activities in 1999 in connection with the rules of competition and the issue of state aid.
</seg>
<seg id=413>
The Commission has followed acting firm and especially against cartels and the abuse of a dominant position.
</seg>
<seg id=414>
Mr Rapkay, so the Commission has been very important to have the support of the European Parliament in the search for its competition policy and I do not believe that that support will disappear.
</seg>
<seg id=415>
This mechanism can be activated or at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a provision which is still in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for the countries which are now are the subject of an exception, namely Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
</seg>
<seg id=416>
For the future, recourse to the capital market should remain the only option.
</seg>
<seg id=417>
I therefore ask that the report in its present form will receive the conformity of the House and that this can also be used in the field of material propagation of the vine in the internal market.
</seg>
<seg id=418>
Today, its review is necessary in view of developments in regulations phytosanitary and scientific progress and technical made, in particular as far as the increase in vitro refers
</seg>
<seg id=419>
Furthermore, with this precautionary principle, I believe that refer to the possibility of genetic modifications means, for example, to reduce the intensive use of plant protection treatments; moreover, in the sense of precautionary the amendments by Mrs
</seg>
<seg id=420>
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the precautionary principle, both in letter and in spirit, if unfortunately articles and amendments just mentioned were not removed, we need to stick to the view Marianne Isler Béguin, and therefore of the Committee on the Environment, and vote in favour of its abolition.
</seg>
<seg id=421>
Mr President, if I may: Commissioner, could you give us its opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, public Health and consumer Policy? is Amendment No 1.
</seg>
<seg id=422>
The only point on which we could discuss is whether I should have noted or not on the French Government I sent the resolution languor of Mr Le Pen' s mandate.
</seg>
<seg id=423>
I would remind you that the vote will take place later, at 12.30 noon.
</seg>
<seg id=424>
In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the civil judicial cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=425>
The preparatory group will play its full role until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.
</seg>
<seg id=426>
We needed climate that that this as has been said by Mr Moscovici and I too was, at the level of Heads of State or Government, a feeling very serious collective responsibility and of a historic moment in European integration.
</seg>
<seg id=427>
Simply be, ladies and gentlemen, ensure that from now on, with regard to these matters of qualified majority voting, so that we do not find ourselves below the spirit or the climate of Biarritz.
</seg>
<seg id=428>
Let the small countries are not on the orders of the larger countries of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=429>
I would appreciate the President-in-Office to clarify this point.
</seg>
<seg id=430>
On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.
</seg>
<seg id=431>
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, although progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, there are profound disagreements on the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out.
</seg>
<seg id=432>
It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.
</seg>
<seg id=433>
Those who are outside enhanced cooperation actually enjoy the same freedom that passengers seats back a car.
</seg>
<seg id=434>
I am not here, nor the honourable Member for ingerirme in internal affairs Germans, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is, moreover, the direction that the Commission wanted, if I am not mistaken.
</seg>
<seg id=435>
We have started to exchange views on this subject, it follows that all Member States wish to maintaining this ceiling after enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=436>
I believe that this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id=437>
The first is that we have sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz had an obsession with the debate between the Member States the small and the large.
</seg>
<seg id=438>
From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that we must safeguard the Community method.
</seg>
<seg id=439>
Also, when the candidate countries accede, each Member State must be able to maintain a Commissioner or deputy chief.
</seg>
<seg id=440>
The wording of the text of Article 93 is all the more dramatic terms that, once achieved the first wave of enlargement, we will find it even more difficult to move towards qualified majority voting.
</seg>
<seg id=441>
We must convince the citizens of these countries of the merits clear of any new European Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=442>
Imagine that fears fed for generations could yield without new upsets the appeasement definitive prelude to reconciliation, it would have been ignore the workings of this crisis.
</seg>
<seg id=443>
I also intranquiliza no correspondence on the issue which calls for Parliament on democratisation.
</seg>
<seg id=444>
Those guilty of this are rather those who advocate made major reforms before enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=445>
On the one hand, the decision by the head of the Israeli Government to freeze the peace negotiations by violence in the region and focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the leader of the opposition, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=446>
We have learned with great satisfaction the victory of the Yugoslav people and the choice of Kostunica as chairman.
</seg>
<seg id=447>
I advise Mr Barón Crespo to ask your colleagues Italian I explain why are in government in Italy with a party decidedly communist and why are preparing to take part in political elections with another party decidedly Communist Party to overhaul Communist.
</seg>
<seg id=448>
On the contrary, in this area we need to make progress in the application of the codecision procedure.
</seg>
<seg id=449>
The Commission, which has the possibility of adopting decisions by simple majority is in a situation that is more favourable to give this momentum in the future.
</seg>
<seg id=450>
The Union does not need now visionaries who have the telescope because in the year 2030, but that needs leaders who are able to attract the problems that will bring the completion of enlargement in a period of 3 to 8 years, as well as for providing answers to them.
</seg>
<seg id=451>
So this is an open work which has not fallen from above and has not been imposed.
</seg>
<seg id=452>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=453>
Without this fundamental reference, at best we understand each other and, at worst, we slaughtered each other.
</seg>
<seg id=454>
Democracy has improved in Europe, but, for its part, European democracy is sick.
</seg>
<seg id=455>
Today, 24 October 2000 in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says something simple, and I say this as a very high: is the European Constitution? yes, you can achieve that, yes, we want.
</seg>
<seg id=456>
In other words, the same expresses the idea that insularity in itself is a criterion enough.
</seg>
<seg id=457>
I will go to the essential concentrándome in the salient points of the report by President Gil-Robles, of which I will simply say that I find excellent.
</seg>
<seg id=458>
Firstly, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.
</seg>
<seg id=459>
I am not going to go further, because we are not here - in any case, I am not here - to discuss the report of the Institute in Florence.
</seg>
<seg id=460>
According to the information - I am going to be technical, forgive me - which has been communicated to the Presidency, I believe that a clear majority of the language versions, contrary to the Italian version, only refers to the implementation of cohesion policy, to the least favoured islands, and not to islands in general.
</seg>
<seg id=461>
Mr Duhamel, no doubt you will agree with me when I say that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no room, at least there will be no credibility, to reflect on the future of European integration, at least in the current framework.
</seg>
<seg id=462>
This European Constitution must also establish a clear distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union and incorporate the dynamics of European integration in those areas, such as foreign and security policy, where there is a need for common action.
</seg>
<seg id=463>
They could also be necessary to overcome blockages persistent.
</seg>
<seg id=464>
Be clarify the distribution of competences and the principle of subsidiarity.
</seg>
<seg id=465>
As you know, in the various Member States and between the various social forces there are many different opinions on this.
</seg>
<seg id=466>
Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European constitution would be exactly the opposite, and it is clear that we cannot approve it.
</seg>
<seg id=467>
Indeed, in the home strengthened European peoples will be invited to the Bureau military monetary, possibly tax, and then the other peoples, which will be alongside.
</seg>
<seg id=468>
It is clear that the second version is incorrect because, firstly, in one way or another Structural Funds cover regions economically disadvantaged and, secondly, because if this interpretation was the correct not, the adoption of the statement nº30.
</seg>
<seg id=469>
Mr President, I shall concentrate my small sixty seconds in the report by Olivier Duhamel, which is a good report, because dares to say things clearly, and the other of our rapporteur has convinced us definitely this a short while ago.
</seg>
<seg id=470>
In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be policy.
</seg>
<seg id=471>
We believe that the new Constitution should be about to enter into force for the next European elections.
</seg>
<seg id=472>
Consequently, the epithet "least developed" applies both to the island regions and the rest of the regions and, according to the proposal by Mr Barnier, to be here is a change in the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.
</seg>
<seg id=473>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=474>
As my colleague said that it was going to vote against this amendment lapses.
</seg>
<seg id=475>
Mr President, what is being called for here is a formula for chaos.
</seg>
<seg id=476>
I welcome the adoption by Parliament of the Trakatellis report, because it has to be set high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives.
</seg>
<seg id=477>
If the European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should have required of waiving Mr Le Pen.
</seg>
<seg id=478>
I am particularly disappointed by the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the proliferation of vineyards.
</seg>
<seg id=479>
For some, alcohol is as tobacco and drugs, a product which damages public much to those who consume and the people around them; others, however, see it above all as a source of employment and something with which one can gain a lot of money.
</seg>
<seg id=480>
The rapporteur welcomes generally welcome the proposals of the Commission' s White Paper on this subject, but it is worried about the possible consequences of the reform, mainly oriented towards decentralise the application of the competition rules.
</seg>
<seg id=481>
- (FR) although, in the debate yesterday evening, I congratulated Jonathan Evans on his work, I first of all to express my deep disagreement with the approach excessively liberal, even ultraliberal, of his report.
</seg>
<seg id=482>
The Agency for industrial development of Ireland has been reorganising its direction to achieve half of the new jobs as a result of projects in new areas in the Objective 1 region over the next three years.
</seg>
<seg id=483>
The state intervention, funding and other financial incentives or tax sometimes come to something to balance this situation before the alarido which cause the consequences of this policy.
</seg>
<seg id=484>
(The sitting was suspended at 14.06 p.m. and resumed at 15.00 p.m.)
</seg>
<seg id=485>
The situation in October 2000, when the run-up to take a decision on the figures for the 2001 budget, is as follows.
</seg>
<seg id=486>
However, the Council did not hesitate to reduce agricultural expenditure by EUR 555 million in total.
</seg>
<seg id=487>
Moreover, we also believe, of course, that should not be simply create 400 additional posts, in addition to the existing ones.
</seg>
<seg id=488>
I can only recommend to the Council to follow our example.
</seg>
<seg id=489>
The administration of this House therefore needs to be at the service of Members and not the other way round.
</seg>
<seg id=490>
The Court of Auditors is the least concerns causes us at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id=491>
Finally, we also have to examine the Ombudsman' s budget.
</seg>
<seg id=492>
On the contrary, we believe that we should strengthen research, particularly with a view to the accession of the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=493>
We also propose that we continue to report regularly to Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=494>
And when we have a conciliation legislation on social affairs, culture or the environment - the Commissioner will admit that I am right - we met the budget Commissioner, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to read together, so that we do not commit a nonsense financial.
</seg>
<seg id=495>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your support.
</seg>
<seg id=496>
Moreover, in giving room for manoeuvre, particularly as regards the limits of category 3 and category 4, the Council wants to give Parliament, ultimately responsible in relation to these non-compulsory expenditure, the opportunity to express its priorities without again cast doubt upon the Council and therefore simply, the salient points of the draft budget of the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=497>
These two issues are often recurring in the discussions between Parliament and the Council and that could give pattern, if we are not careful, tensions between both branches of the budgetary authority.
</seg>
<seg id=498>
The situation is similar when it comes to the structural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=499>
The outcome of the conciliation this summer was also satisfactory, as has already been pointed out by Mr Colom i Naval, specifically in the sense that in the future will enlarge also informing Parliament in relation to the legal bases with repercussions on expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=500>
Let me remind you that in the Financial Perspective which was adopted last year only be predicted 1,850 million for the Balkans for the entire period until 2006.
</seg>
<seg id=501>
I would ask you once again to examine this proposal - the Commission left on the table - judgments without without without the envisages also as a possibility.
</seg>
<seg id=502>
This material was obviously useful for the preparation of the budget for 2001 and for granting the discharge for the 1999 financial year.
</seg>
<seg id=503>
Despite the fact that, as a member of the same, I very much appreciate the work of this committee and despite the great respect I have for the work of the rapporteurs, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I must insist on two amendments that our committee is once again proposing now before the House and which remain important but have been reduced the figures.
</seg>
<seg id=504>
With these measures we propose to ensure that judicial control will function fully restore confidence in the legal security within the European Union and consolidate its nature of Community of law.
</seg>
<seg id=505>
The removal of this initiative on the part of the Commission, without replacing it with any other, was clearly contrary to the political will of the Lisbon Summit and the priorities of this House.
</seg>
<seg id=506>
This was a decision staggering and many of us had the feeling that this very important programme had become just a football in a match between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=507>
The third issue is the European agricultural policy as now appears in the draft budget.
</seg>
<seg id=508>
If employment is the political priority of the Union, fisheries, as an economic sector more, cannot stay aloof.
</seg>
<seg id=509>
I am particularly pleased that he has been able to guarantee the financing of programmes Socrates, the the Culture 2000, which finalizaban at the end of last year.
</seg>
<seg id=510>
For example, our aid to the Mediterranean countries has a delay affecting the budgets for many years.
</seg>
<seg id=511>
Mr President, in the debates in previous years I spoke on behalf of the Committee on culture, youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has been Mrs Iivari this afternoon.
</seg>
<seg id=512>
But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends only 1% of GDP and the administration of a large part is led by the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=513>
Let me turn to the global strategy.
</seg>
<seg id=514>
This brings me to the strategy of our group, because the essence of our concept is the wish of funds having an adequate return for European citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=515>
On the contrary, we must work for a Parliament which campaigning in favour of transparency, efficiency and democratic control effective European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=516>
When that happens we must consider how we can resolve this problem.
</seg>
<seg id=517>
We want to promote democratisation processes and we want to maintain a balanced relationship between the traditional areas of foreign policy now that that that.
</seg>
<seg id=518>
The biggest problems in the preliminary draft budgets relate to external actions.
</seg>
<seg id=519>
Of course, we need a rigorous management; we support it and we should not try to discharged.
</seg>
<seg id=520>
An initiative is extremely exceptional, especially at first reading, and it is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, obtain a majority of votes.
</seg>
<seg id=521>
Having said that, the importance of funding for Kosovo still raises some problems.
</seg>
<seg id=522>
Budgetary policy must ensure that the citizens have confidence in European politics.
</seg>
<seg id=523>
All the measures designed to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises also therefore deserve our support.
</seg>
<seg id=524>
The level of budgetary implementation;
</seg>
<seg id=525>
Preserving this strategic line in the approach to the budget this year and next, the European Parliament has its full space in the budgetary process.

Ramiro Zapata was the last of the 25 human rights activists murdered, and recently the Colombian press has denounced the plan "100" of the paramilitary groups to kill human rights activists.

Today I am a little more satisfied that in July with the attitude of the Council, because, as many times in crisis situations, the European Union always seems the final authority to reach the international stage and make its voice heard.

The question, Mr President, and I will end here, is whether there is a formula pressure of the proposal by the President in his information and if the aid that we are going to give will be completely different to that of the United States, that is not addressed to the fumigation of crops, but the replacement of crops and also to the social aspects and not to the military.

Subject: tax on financial transactions the demand for a taxation of speculative capital has been gaining ground in recent months, with the proliferation of committees (ATTAC association pour taxation unites them South Transactions financières et pour l l'aide aux citoyens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled in the French National Assembly and in the Senate from the same country.
</seg>
<seg id=536>
Furthermore, I would like to answer the question of its influence on the volatility of the currency markets and, especially, of the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators who expect devaluations in the order of 20 to 50%.

I would add, to what he said Danielle Auroi earlier in relation to the countries of the South, which some estimates made by specialists, give interesting figures: for example, a range which runs from 50,000 to 250,000 billion dollars, which could recover from a Tobin-type tax. the UNDP, for its part, estimated at EUR 40,000 billion dollars a year, an amount which could be enough to give living conditions minimum hundreds of millions of people who are all in third world countries.

With a flexible position by the Council, an agreement can be reached at second reading to close the budget.
</seg>
<seg id=548>
If someone is not yet convinced that, just look at the evidence.
</seg>
<seg id=549>
Joan Colom i Naval, Vice-President responsible for buildings, has already introduced such a strategy.
</seg>
<seg id=550>
Political messages in this year' s budget are, as stated by Commissioner Schreyer - many. the restructuring of agricultural policy, the new structural programmes, ensure better implementation of structural policy, the follow-up to the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit relating to the creation of an EU stronger and more competitive and to the fight against social exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=551>
NATO' s war has done too many havoc and has caused much misery.
</seg>
<seg id=552>
Despite what was agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective with the current budgetary constraints without undermining the agricultural budget necessary for a sector sustainable rural in the current Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=553>
And I say so clear and unequivocal: you Kostunica must be given a chance and I hope that in the coming weeks and months put in place an amnesty, but in the meantime I would like that at political level and budgetary put political conditions to the implementation of these two new budget lines, that is to say, democratisation and reconstruction.

Not to do so, caímos inevitably in the "financial engineering" , in redistribution and cuts either in general expenses either in social expenditure and environmental either in cooperation, but the fact is that, despite this, the allocations for the Balkans will remain inadequate.

<seg id=557>
In this context, efforts are required to resolve the major social problems such as unemployment.
</seg>
<seg id=558>
There is an issue that is of course very important: we have begun focussing category four, but has not yet been entirely clear whether we have been able to give you a solution, not least because the Council refuses in resounding to contribute ideas.
</seg>
<seg id=559>
In any budgetary work are important priorities.

This is not very serious on the horizon next to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if framework The the maintained the possibility of extending practices of this kind.
</seg>
<seg id=561>
And that brings me to my third point, the challenge ahead of us.
</seg>
<seg id=562>
The new financial agreement does not say anything about it. I could see that European citizens distrust increasingly politicians.
</seg>
<seg id=563>
I pay tribute to them for that.
</seg>
<seg id=564>
The availability to dialogue between all the institutions involved has given rise to an exemplary collaboration which will enable us, I sincerely hope, to reach a consensus at first reading.
</seg>
<seg id=565>
Those who represent European values in a country sceptical of the EU are now a new argument in favour of the Union, that is, better protection of personal integrity, something that is important for the people in modern society.
</seg>
<seg id=566>
In my own country you reform the law of personal data, depriving the parliamentary power on the decisions of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=567>
Many other points also pose problems and deserve the trial of practice to be insured.
</seg>
<seg id=568>
The Commission would firstly point out the compromise that we have all taken with the citizens to ensure the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=569>
With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation will be limited to the activities of the first pillar.
</seg>
<seg id=570>
With a view to honour the political agreement concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to allow the adoption at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment which does not belong to the Paciotti report adopted by the parliamentary Committee on Citizens' freedoms and rights, with the exception of Amendment No 69 which corrects Amendment No 41.
</seg>
<seg id=571>
It is therefore urgent that the staff of the interservice group being strengthened quickly at the heart of the Secretary-General of the Commission, so that all acts of proposed general scope could be accompanied, during its examination by the College, in accordance with Article 299, paragraph for a detailed impact statement.
</seg>
<seg id=572>
From the point of view of the Committee on legal Affairs and the Internal market, what I want to stress is that, indeed, can only be dealt with like what remains the same.
</seg>
<seg id=573>
Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I must feel sorrow about this.
</seg>
<seg id=574>
Until now, since under the chairmanship of Delors the setting-up of an inter-service group for the outermost regions, we have come a long and fruitful path and who has chaired the Group I must express the deep appreciation of Europeans outermost.
</seg>
<seg id=575>
Indeed, although even before the Treaty of Rome referred to the French overseas departments, it was not until 1989 and programmes specific actions linked to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI, so that the European Union finally admit that the permanence and combination of structural problems of the outermost regions justified specific treatment with regard to the other regions of the Community.
</seg>
<seg id=576>
I have no doubt that the proposals which the Commission presents to the Council will bear the stamp of these qualities.
</seg>
<seg id=577>
This issue is becoming increasingly important as we move towards the eastward enlargement of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=578>
And it should be noted that this right to difference is no more than a product of the principle of equality, which also requires treated differently what is different.
</seg>
<seg id=579>
It is a document that my staff and I believe rich in ideas and which does not shirk any of the issues of concern to the outermost regions of the Community.
</seg>
<seg id=580>
Your report, Mrs Sudre, quite rightly emphasises the need to act in time. earlier.
</seg>
<seg id=581>
With regard to the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in several key areas.
</seg>
<seg id=582>
It is now important that are present in the framework of the DOCUPS a large number of projects, but, in parallel with this action on the ground, we have to consider thoroughly the specific needs, access, each of these outermost regions to this information society.

Both the Food Authority as legislative proposals that we propose, seeking to guarantee food safety, will have the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=587>
Its main task is to provide scientific advice, since the debate on food safety must also be credible.
</seg>
<seg id=588>
Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and their willingness to take into account the opinion of the other committees.
</seg>
<seg id=589>
When we are faced with a possible risk is important to apply the precautionary principle.
</seg>
<seg id=590>
On the issue still controversial how far we should go in regard to allow it to examine nutrition, and even to submit recommendations and be consulted by those whose main task is to risk management, we have also said that in the field of security, the issues should at least be subject to public opinion and the advice of the food authority.
</seg>
<seg id=591>
A central idea is to ensure the survival of the rich heritage traditions.
</seg>
<seg id=592>
It is not the laws or regulations which form the basis for this respectability, but the integrity, high quality academic, independence, the sense of responsibility, transparency and comprehensibility.
</seg>
<seg id=593>
Certainly, it is essential to proceed on the basis of sound scientific knowledge, to assess the risks associated with the food chain, from farm to table.
</seg>
<seg id=594>
Mr President, it is clear that there is a considerable enthusiasm for the creation of a European food safety agency, as our rapporteur prefers calling it a.
</seg>
<seg id=595>
Given that the programme of the WHO continues with the money and the support necessary, it seems that there is absolutely no need for another agency, especially one with such limited scope such as the 15 Member States of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=596>
Food safety is the basic precondition for the consumer because consumers want to eat healthily and that we need to address us.
</seg>
<seg id=597>
If we do not get a new framework directive many aspects relating to food safety will only be a dead letter.
</seg>
<seg id=598>
Consequently, we need to change the EU Treaty in such a way that it gives the Commission power to impose sanctions in the food field, in the same way as currently being done in the field of competition.
</seg>
<seg id=599>
Support for all those who support the strategy "food for All" and working in the political field, administrative or any other.
</seg>
<seg id=600>
I do not share these words, because we know that man is not only body.
</seg>
<seg id=601>
This should represent the real heart of coordination of the network of the national agencies which, in turn, must set in motion and coordinate a network of centres of excellence food safety at regional level.
</seg>
<seg id=602>
I therefore believe that his Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.
</seg>
<seg id=603>
The reform of the food laws of the European Union will be carried out at European Union level.
</seg>
<seg id=604>
Her report contains no many amendments, but only to emphasise certain issues.
</seg>
<seg id=605>
It says very clearly in the report and I welcome that.
</seg>
<seg id=606>
However, the creation of a European authority food safety is very positive.
</seg>
<seg id=607>
It is to be hoped that fulfil all these criteria for the good of the citizens of the Union as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id=608>
I think that it is essential to establish temporary margins in certain those who will be informed the European Commission in cases of justified concern.
</seg>
<seg id=609>
The EU must have the highest standards possible food safety for its citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=610>
The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Authority.
</seg>
<seg id=611>
I fear that Europe once again run the risk of afford a inflated apparatus officials who is unable to act.
</seg>
<seg id=612>
As we create new levels of bureaucracy and spend more money, is increasingly less what we get in return.
</seg>
<seg id=613>
To prevent similar work or parallel in several institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=614>
However, we must avoid under the debate on the White Paper, increases in public opinion the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which has a bearing on the quality of products, without penalizing effectively fraud that threaten the health of consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=615>
As you know, the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety.
</seg>
<seg id=616>
The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation to establish the principles and objectives global food legislation, which will provide the framework for the future measures of health protection in food.
</seg>
<seg id=617>
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=618>
Turning now to our report, I support the Commission' s proposal and I have to say that the Parliamentary committees foreign and development have worked hard to improve it further, especially on some points.
</seg>
<seg id=619>
As he said very explicit and clear Mrs Bonino, with the Commission' s proposal for a regulation has been given a new step forward.
</seg>
<seg id=620>
The Commission' s proposal for a regulation is far too vague.
</seg>
<seg id=621>
It is necessary for the appropriation for de-mining is organised in a reasonable way and that fund research work for work detection and disposal, so that instruments can be used in a simple way on the ground to provide aid precisely in developing countries.
</seg>
<seg id=622>
Over the last eight years, we have contributed more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget, the fight against landmines.
</seg>
<seg id=623>
But we cannot penalise those who have a bad governance.
</seg>
<seg id=624>
Firstly, as I have already mentioned, I think it would be a mistake, well-intentioned, but counterproductive, impose accession to the Ottawa Convention as a prerequisite for Community assistance to mine action.

Mr President, I am delighted that has finally European legislation, in the form of a regulation, on anti-personnel mines and today we have a good report by Mrs Bonino on it.
</seg>
<seg id=633>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing something very sad.
</seg>
<seg id=634>
It is no coincidence that mines are mainly in crisis areas, that is to say, in areas in which could have been taken another type of initiatives in order to overcome this crisis.
</seg>
<seg id=635>
Two kilometres of a village in Bosnia, in 1999, in a field a signal warns the existence of mines, which does not prevent the presence of a child.
</seg>
<seg id=636>
It is tragic that it is the civilian population who suffer as a result of the ineptitude of their leaders.
</seg>
<seg id=637>
Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, welcome them on behalf of our institution, with which their country maintains special relationships within the framework of our common project of building an area of prosperity, security and peace around the Mediterranean basin.
</seg>
<seg id=638>
All mines are stored.
</seg>
<seg id=639>
Mr President, as I agree with almost everything that was said earlier by my colleagues, I will not repeat. I waive my speaking time.
</seg>
<seg id=640>
The idea that you have of open cooperation is falling into the institutional framework dominated by Commission officials.
</seg>
<seg id=641>
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to the people who will be affected.
</seg>
<seg id=642>
But as essential amendments from the EPP Group have just gain a substantial majority, I voted in favour of the report.
</seg>
<seg id=643>
Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz for two types of reasons: firstly, because I have had the opportunity to vote, recorded, separately, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has enabled me to express my opposition to both head-on.

</seg>
<seg id=661>
In fact, the peculiarities of these regions in general, due to the insularity and the remoteness from the continent of Europe, but also to the chronic dependence on a single production or a few, require specific measures appropriate to overcome those limitations.

We can make it clear that the aim of the agency is to channel the powers of national defence, or paralizarlos, to put at the service of the Commission' s objectives.

Nevertheless, the Commission and Parliament denominen this agency "European authority" designation, totally contrary to the spirit in which it is based.

This is not what we proposed the Bowis report, which gives the impression that food safety is considered primarily as an excuse to feed the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of national bodies and bodies that protect the safety of the citizens.

Listening to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committees, some of which have been here longer than I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, to which this Parliament is being submitted for a fourth time, falls into this category.
</seg>
<seg id=701>
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you in advance the support that will bring to my report.
</seg>
<seg id=702>
If we reject this political action at European level, must then be given more opportunities to the regions.
</seg>
<seg id=703>
SMEs are the main source of job creation, in both quality and quantity. play an essential role in social cohesion and to town and country planning.
</seg>
<seg id=704>
The attention it did the study of proposals and the concertation which has pursued with many interested parties have been a triumph for better define and optimise the establishment of this programme.
</seg>
<seg id=705>
Thirdly, we must look for European added value.
</seg>
<seg id=706>
It follows that small and medium-sized enterprises can only go well if the unemployment rate is reduced and public administrations at all levels are not debt and have adequate resources to send to the budgets of investment.
</seg>
<seg id=707>
Businesses need clarity.
</seg>
<seg id=708>
In particular, if an employer individually or a company with 250 employees has a project, cannot be the only way to receive funding the Constitution guarantees of 120%, but must also be possible to obtain funding for which has only a good idea.
</seg>
<seg id=709>
The Member States, and even the regional authorities or local already behave like real financial bombs, which drenan taxpayers' money, i.e. sums are held to the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, and I bombean to big business and therefore towards their owners and shareholders.
</seg>
<seg id=710>
The breeding ground for small and medium-sized enterprises includes thousands of fragile attempts that nourished by human potential and ideas for big business.
</seg>
<seg id=711>
Of the measures we have proposed here, which I would most like to address the Commissioner is to facilitate and speed up access to aid and information for the people who addressed these companies can use them effectively.
</seg>
<seg id=712>
All of them will be high on the multiannual programme.
</seg>
<seg id=713>
Finally, I welcome the idea of an annual ritual endeavour to carry out an assessment of the implementation of the programme.
</seg>
<seg id=714>
The recent incidents at the expense of the Greek minority in southern Himara made more urgent need to promote democratisation process, strengthening the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
</seg>
<seg id=715>
A considerable number of Albanians abandons its land by the uncertainty that prevails in your country, for the social difficulties, for their social structures and family premodernas.
</seg>
<seg id=716>
We need preventive measures specially designed for Albania which contribute to the construction or reconstruction of the country in order to make possible a dignified life in the region.
</seg>
<seg id=717>
That is how going from one jurisdiction to the other documents and the European Commission, for example, refuses to publish the report on, among other things, the customs Assistance Mission (CAM), drawn up by the Albanians.
</seg>
<seg id=718>
We see the truth as it stands.
</seg>
<seg id=719>
Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view broad and extensive evidence that his report.
</seg>
<seg id=720>
It is a matter of the utmost importance, created under the influence of factors historical, social, political and economic.
</seg>
<seg id=721>
We will never know the real number of deaths.
</seg>
<seg id=722>
Commercial activities the amendments to the people in a peaceful manner.
</seg>
<seg id=723>
What, on the contrary, I find unacceptable in this report, and I say this quite frankly, it being confused the effect to the cause, that is to say, it being confused the procedure issue of visas and therefore the possibility to emigrate, with the result of illegal immigration.
</seg>
<seg id=724>
The major institutional reforms arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam have influenced the management of the issues of asylum and immigration.
</seg>
<seg id=725>
Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its methods of implementation must be assessed by areas.
</seg>
<seg id=726>
But, of course, this order we also requires us not go overboard in the volume of adoption of Community rules.
</seg>
<seg id=727>
Precisely now must be emphasised the strength of Community action.
</seg>
<seg id=728>
I am also that the changes to the proposals on codification of European legislation in force are carried out by including amendments in the directive or regulations in force.
</seg>
<seg id=729>
Understood with property, the principle of subsidiarity points in two directions: decision-making at the lowest possible level, and the recognition that the lowest possible level can be, in fact, a very high level, when there is general goods at stake that will be lost unless that are protected in the same terms everywhere.
</seg>
<seg id=730>
The report is a model of draft clear and concise and I hope that colleagues will take with the seriousness it deserves.
</seg>
<seg id=731>
The report by the Committee on legal Affairs and the Internal market not had the enthusiasm of its members.
</seg>
<seg id=732>
That is what I meant in the report on the draft slim, because Community legislation, and Mr Medina we just try reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, it is difficult to understand, even for the experts.
</seg>
<seg id=733>
Therefore, I some aspects of the report I produce little enthusiasm, because I would have liked the report more "comunitarizante" with regard to the internal market and, above all, on this point, of course, are not the winds blowing in the report.
</seg>
<seg id=734>
What is important for the EU institutions is that we have a strong commitment to raise the quality of legislation, particularly with regard to subsidiarity.
</seg>
<seg id=735>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=736>
Maintaining this situation could have a negative effect on acceptance and in the opinion of citizens about the euro.
</seg>
<seg id=737>
Mr President, in the Committee on Citizens' freedoms and rights, Justice and home affairs prepare a thorough the Karamanou report.
</seg>
<seg id=738>
However, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take this oral question and this debate to express on both sides - which is directed both our motion for a resolution - and I do so with great composure, some considerations.
</seg>
<seg id=739>
The peoples of the Union that we represent here so demand.
</seg>
<seg id=740>
But, since much has been water under the bridge, the agreement has passed and has not been replaced.
</seg>
<seg id=741>
I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but I cannot understand the Director-General.
</seg>
<seg id=742>
We could say that, months after the mooring, we are still paying the previous agreement and the previous the previous.
</seg>
<seg id=743>
Mr President, a year ago we had a similar debate and the fact that he had to spend a year to see the opening of negotiations highlights the difficulty of finding grounds for the enormous EU fleets.
</seg>
<seg id=744>
In the second agreement, things were very clear.
</seg>
<seg id=745>
But we must also understand that nothing is eternal, it even fishery resources.
</seg>
<seg id=746>
That is why I am particularly keen to make it clear that if something has been highlighted the PPE-DE Group is not only in support, defend and promote the fisheries agreements, but rather to promote firmly to its size.
</seg>
<seg id=747>
Thirdly, since it was interrupted the fisheries agreement, has continued the exploitation of waters of Western Sahara by Community fleets and non-Community which are not subject to control and the Commission or the Member States: we talk above all an important fleet in the Netherlands.
</seg>
<seg id=748>
I understand that, since these fisheries represented a source of income and work for a poor region in relation to the rest of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=749>
Another aspect that I would like to highlight is that at the end of the month concludes the temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners to compensate for this year staging: it is an untenable situation, given that all prefer to work for aid.
</seg>
<seg id=750>
This parliamentary andalucista brings a year negotiating and proposing initiatives by the corridors, by the offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner to take account of the especialísima character of the fishing fleet Andalusia fishing in Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=751>
Spain has developed in a remarkable way the most difficult neighbourly relationship has to that in history between Europe and North Africa, between Spain and Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=752>
As a parliamentarian Spanish and Andalusian, I support the right of thousands families of Spanish to maintain and defend, and to defend also from this Parliament, their jobs, which are in danger for almost a year.
</seg>
<seg id=753>
It will come now to the vote.
</seg>
<seg id=754>
A history of almost twelve years full of consuelos since the cancillería, delaying tactics, hopes, need of, placebos for those affected, defence of old rights vis-à-vis the citizens who do not looking for something else that their rights.
</seg>
<seg id=755>
As you know, the matter is very complex and affects some people working in over twenty-five Italian universities.
</seg>
<seg id=756>
If we reform and change the legal system Italian, as has happened for staff University, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene as soon as all European citizens enjoy equal access to all professional categories.
</seg>
<seg id=757>
The injustice lies in the fact that two people who do the same work, working hand in hand, I do, however, with different salaries and under different conditions.
</seg>
<seg id=758>
Worst of all, in my view, is having to inform you that a favourable judgment may not constitute more than some reassuring words and will not be a real change in their lives.
</seg>
<seg id=759>
I would remind the Commission that I hope to respond to what the Court' s ruling in Case the expressing the as follows: "by this dictates that is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty that the law of a Member State restricted in any case the duration of contracts work of the foreign language assistants to one year, with the possibility of renewal, if not in principle applies that limit other teachers" .
</seg>
<seg id=760>
Well, I believe that these matters are leading to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, in particular freedom of movement, and we cannot make exceptions to these principles.
</seg>
<seg id=761>
We still have jobs, as today has been in this discussion, too many obstacles, too many obstacles to the internal market, and not just in this case.
</seg>
<seg id=762>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=763>
(The President cut the speaker off)
</seg>
<seg id=764>
And I propose a minute of respect.
</seg>
<seg id=765>
Are there any comments?
</seg>
<seg id=766>
I support the proposal put forward by Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful if the Council could clarify if there is real intentions to present a new proposal on this matter.
</seg>
<seg id=767>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group believes that this important event which we do not think would receive suitable treatment in the form of a matter of urgency.
</seg>
<seg id=768>
Galeote have just described. I have the impression that you adheres to these reasons, Mr Barón Crespo, if I understood him correctly.
</seg>
<seg id=769>
Madam President, some time ago we discussed in this Parliament the issue of sanctions against Iraq.
</seg>
<seg id=770>
It is a matter of urgency that we hold a debate before the introduction of the amendment proposed by the British authorities, and that the Commission will send a clear signal is what the rules must be observed in this respect.
</seg>
<seg id=771>
(A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' freedoms and rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, especially in the field of the fight against organised crime, laundering of the proceeds of infringements and crime in financial matters C5-0394/2000.
</seg>
<seg id=772>
The statements must be followed by practical measures taken to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
</seg>
<seg id=773>
The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of an agency specialised, subject only to the control of the national governments.
</seg>
<seg id=774>
Furthermore, Article 8 of the draft convention just about essential interests the grounds for refusing assistance which could invoke the requested state.
</seg>
<seg id=775>
I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Marinho for the work he has done and I would like to say that, indeed, attempts to combat organised crime must enjoy support and attention.
</seg>
<seg id=776>
Traced, pursue, condemn the laundering of dirty money terrorists and arms brokers and drugs, it certainly yes!
</seg>
<seg id=777>
Our task is to proceed to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organized crime.
</seg>
<seg id=778>
All these considerations are contained in the amendments and, judging by the debate in the committee, I very much hope that Parliament will adopt these amendments.
</seg>
<seg id=779>
In my opinion, the establishment of these initiatives is progressing in a way which can ignore the protection provided for in Article 6 of the European Convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms.
</seg>
<seg id=780>
However, in reality, this is not so easy.
</seg>
<seg id=781>
Finally, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on the activities of lawyers.
</seg>
<seg id=782>
The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation.
</seg>
<seg id=783>
It is a Portuguese initiative as that which several previous speakers.
</seg>
<seg id=784>
And that was the subject of the joint meeting of the justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council on 17 October.
</seg>
<seg id=785>
The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control of Europol is the full integration of the Europol Convention within the legal framework of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=786>
A step in the right direction that the European Parliament tries to provide for a long time is the creation of a provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit.
</seg>
<seg id=787>
This is the sense of guarantees, namely to advance this aspect of freedoms.
</seg>
<seg id=788>
The European Parliament is the body supranational Community able to establish this relationship, and with this intervention I propose therefore to support this right to support our rapporteur
</seg>
<seg id=789>
Only when the institutional model and rules that will govern the European area of justice are clarified, it will be possible for citizens and for Parliament to express an opinion on each of the measures proposed by the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=790>
For this reason, Europol is a logical step in the process to give the citizens a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice, by strengthening the fight against organised crime.
</seg>
<seg id=791>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt is to be congratulated on the excellent report he has presented, in line with the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.
</seg>
<seg id=792>
But given that Eurojust, there is the coordination of the tax and national courts to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the rapporteur' s approach - the broad concept: we no longer talk only of cooperation for crimes purely transnational also refers to cooperation in the fight against criminal activities.
</seg>
<seg id=793>
We will have the opportunity, as from 1 January 2001, go in the provisional unit, but the Commission wants to hold a debate on what should be the final unity of Eurojust.
</seg>
<seg id=794>
Each side sincerely held its position, so I believe, without lapsing into rigid confrontations.
</seg>
<seg id=795>
The problems encountered in expenditure not excessively care to the Committee on Fisheries, although provided more attention to other matters.
</seg>
<seg id=796>
It is totally unacceptable that we have clear objectives or we can measure the results, something that does not happen in any other institution.
</seg>
<seg id=797>
Second point: in the area of the hierarchy in the power of town of payments came here to intersections unacceptable, Commissioner.
</seg>
<seg id=798>
With that I would like to stress that played a positive role in a number of problems.
</seg>
<seg id=799>
It is obvious that this work in consortium does not create any duality in financial responsibility together.
</seg>
<seg id=800>
We therefore really acted to recover EUR 3.4 million, and we can say that we have achieved in more than 90%.
</seg>
<seg id=801>
Are there any comments?
</seg>
<seg id=802>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months of work and long wrangling in the search for a consensus, we now have on the table a draft Charter of fundamental rights.
</seg>
<seg id=803>
I hope that, even if today is limited to regard the adoption of this Charter, this House will make it clear indubitablemente in the coming weeks calling on the Council to the obligation of the Charter and that it also includes the possibility recourse to the European Court of Justice.
</seg>
<seg id=804>
This position is compounded, as you know, adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz in which they themselves adopted unanimously and without reservations, the Charter, and so I can only invite you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, but making them some arguments.
</seg>
<seg id=805>
But above all it is because of the strength of its content which is why the Charter, I am sure, will era.
</seg>
<seg id=806>
For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been able to condemn what she considers gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage, for example.
</seg>
<seg id=807>
However, various personalities, and especially the members of the European Parliament, have proposed to include an explicit reference to the Charter of fundamental rights in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already refers to the Convention on Human Rights.
</seg>
<seg id=808>
Our Group unanimously supports the Charter with the exception of the British delegation.
</seg>
<seg id=809>
The European people' s Party calls in its entirety and unanimously that the Charter of Fundamental rights to be incorporated as soon as possible to the Treaties, so that has the force of law directly to the people of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=810>
They have shown that it is possible to deal with the European affairs in a different way and exemplary, much better than the Intergovernmental Conference, given its work democratic and open, with the greatest transparency and which enables the participation of the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=811>
The right to health, social security, housing, the minimum wage are non-existent or only the order of solidarity.
</seg>
<seg id=812>
Fourthly, the Charter - and this seems to me particularly important - starts from the principle of the indivisibility of human rights of citizenship and political character and the fundamental rights of social order.
</seg>
<seg id=813>
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and our Member States to increase the vacuos texts, declarations of intent.
</seg>
<seg id=814>
The Commission' s representative in the Convention in Turin attaches importance to the legal document.
</seg>
<seg id=815>
Since the time of the market, when the Europe of rights perhaps has come finally. the concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.
</seg>
<seg id=816>
The Charter is drafted, in fact, as a text that can have a binding.
</seg>
<seg id=817>
I can also see with great pride that a representative of my group in my country, Jansson Gunnar, played a central role in the formulation of this Charter.
</seg>
<seg id=818>
As I said last night - and I will say today - throughout the Union there are many shortcomings in this respect and sometimes, with our impatience to develop judicial and police cooperation, overlook the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not passive victims, collateral damage of a war against crime.
</seg>
<seg id=819>
Madam President, the European Parliament' s draft resolution on the Charter of fundamental rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the House.
</seg>
<seg id=820>
The Italian Constitution provides, for example, the limit of good conduct; the Convention provides for the limit of the rights of others, of public order.
</seg>
<seg id=821>
Mr President, today in the vote on the 12 we will conclude a process that began in 1984 when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty of the European Union, where already featured the demand for a bill of rights, a process that we continue in 1989 with the resolution De Gucht.
</seg>
<seg id=822>
The Charter will have effects. the will be whether or not in the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=823>
We must welcome and not with fear, as think the seems seems to think.
</seg>
<seg id=824>
It seems that the century which ends with all their struggles for the emancipation of social classes disadvantaged, past has has has not taught us anything.
</seg>
<seg id=825>
The Charter fills a gap in Community law and strengthens the protection of individuals with regard to the atrocities of the European police force, the authorities combating fraud and the authorities that are responsible for competition.
</seg>
<seg id=826>
I do not understand the dissent of the person motivates because the Charter does not cover everything which I would like to see included.
</seg>
<seg id=827>
Mr President, I will continue where it was Mr Gahrton.
</seg>
<seg id=828>
The third point I should like to make relates to the rights of citizens of third countries.
</seg>
<seg id=829>
The Council of Europe has, along with the Court of Human Rights, with a great deal of experience in such forms of control, which we can use.
</seg>
<seg id=830>
In view of the text of the Charter that we will be approving today - I hope by a large majority - it is clear that in our Charter we will achieve greater protection and also more up-to-date fundamental rights which have been accession to the European Convention for the protection of human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=831>
That is why we need to make further progress.
</seg>
<seg id=832>
I think it is important to bear this in mind if we are to achieve the necessary support of the citizens of Europe to the Charter.
</seg>
<seg id=833>
After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental rights will be guided my analysis for this report and as far as my personal means and intellectuals and the means with regard to colleagues that I facilitate permit me, I should like to make an analysis right by law, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=834>
- (FR) Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission I would like to begin by joining the purposes of President Moscovici, highlight the essential contribution that the Members of the European Parliament have contributed to the debate, to the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Méndez de Vigo has played in the Praesidium of the Convention to the drafting of the Charter of fundamental rights.
</seg>
<seg id=835>
I refer not only to some of the most salient points of this debate: firstly, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=836>
The Convention has chosen to include fundamental rights inspired by the various instruments of the Council of Europe, in the treaties, in the constitutions of the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=837>
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
</seg>
<seg id=838>
In the current state of affairs, also corresponds to our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are currently three conditions for membership.
</seg>
<seg id=839>
As a result, the European Investment Bank is one of the last ports of refuge activities bank in the world. there not tarnish the waves of social debate.
</seg>
<seg id=840>
That is why I have taken good note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the preconditions to Turkey' s accession and deserve the greatest interest.
</seg>
<seg id=841>
I am pleased to announce that the Turkish Government has accepted both between this partnership as a basis for our future cooperation, so that we can good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely the intended aim, which is supported by our political forces reformadoras in Turkey, give new impetus to the process of reform and move with a view to the desired accession to the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=842>
What is most important to me is that from Helsinki has begun in Turkey, between the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for Turkey' s accession to the EU, a debate which gives support to force the amendments the country and promote their development.
</seg>
<seg id=843>
This text is awaiting its opinion.
</seg>
<seg id=844>
What is now intention is to a necessary boost in the scene of a future accession.
</seg>
<seg id=845>
However, I would urge Turkey - I do not know what the result of the vote - also to take this issue seriously.
</seg>
<seg id=846>
The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with political parties, NGOs and the press, in addition to develop their sensitive and sometimes tirante relationship with the grand National Assembly.
</seg>
<seg id=847>
Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, absolutely realistic and responsible.
</seg>
<seg id=848>
During his visit to Turkey in March at least mentioned by name the problem of the Kurdish population, as he has done today.
</seg>
<seg id=849>
Considering that Europeans will lead to the Turks, and I quote, "a radical change in their habits and mentality" at the same time it reveals a great naivety and a great sufficiency.
</seg>
<seg id=850>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today fills me with concern.
</seg>
<seg id=851>
Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) by Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233 (AVC))
</seg>
<seg id=852>
However, in the coming times in which we are going to discuss the computer power, we have to realise that we must control broader and therefore more garantizador of the individual.
</seg>
<seg id=853>
Recommendation Duff/Voggenhuber (A5-0325/2000)
</seg>
<seg id=854>
We note I:
</seg>
<seg id=855>
The rights laid down in the Charter are already part of national constitutions and are defended by the national parliaments, close to the people and their cultures.
</seg>
<seg id=856>
For example, Article 19-1, which states that: "prohibit collective expulsions" , not specifies that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious disruption of public order.
</seg>
<seg id=857>
We are going to give a brief explanation of these three objections in order.
</seg>
<seg id=858>
The right of a government to leave aside arbitrarily its constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.
</seg>
<seg id=859>
But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions under which we have completed this important stage for Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=860>
A society that only aware of rights and duties, not becomes a selfish society.
</seg>
<seg id=861>
It is our priority fight for the affirmation of fundamental rights is incorporated in political elections.
</seg>
<seg id=862>
In spite of the fact that the Convention method is interesting and fruitful to establish a base text, seeking a broad compromise, nothing justifies that will deprive parliament, which embodies the representation of the people of Europe, the possibility of amending, enrich the text.
</seg>
<seg id=863>
This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy to enable its updating and enhancement.
</seg>
<seg id=864>
Therefore, the Charter should not be to decide and proclaimed at the Nice Council, but at that summit should be encouraged a European debate on it.
</seg>
<seg id=865>
Fortunately, the prevailing tendency of national governments seems to indicate the path of common sense, namely the acceptance of the Charter with a range purely political and non-binding.
</seg>
<seg id=866>
Created as "Assembly" by the Cologne Summit, autoproclamó "Convention" , a name that unfortunately recalls to 1793 and the terrorist implications of the French Revolution fulfilled by another convention.
</seg>
<seg id=867>
In exchange, the method used, the exclusions proclaimed and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of this text cast a light rather harsh on the new efervescencias totalitarian operating in the very heart of the process of European integration.
</seg>
<seg id=868>
Fortunately, the European Parliament is still in this field more than an advisory role, pending a full application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but is the way to do so in the wrong direction, slowing down the right decisions.
</seg>
<seg id=869>
On the other hand, there are discrepancies in terms of procedure.
</seg>
<seg id=870>
A century ago was as well and, after making turn back, something is now in force.

Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey joint Parliamentary Committee, have been intense attention to the draft accession of Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id=875>
Nor is it acceptable Turkey' s role in Cyprus.
</seg>
<seg id=876>
However, we support the rapporteur' s criticism that there is a need for an assessment on the granting of loans from the EIB and that there are shortcomings in matters of transparency and democratic control in the Bank' s activities.
</seg>
<seg id=877>
Turkey, with all its differentiation, always has been and continues to be an integral part of the European reality.
</seg>
<seg id=878>
Turkey' s accession to the European Union is now more than ever on an issue on the agenda.
</seg>
<seg id=879>
Mr Morillon says that Turkey must take care not to see the European Union as a Christian club ' which wants to exclude them.

<seg id=880>
Turkey is a country fully democratic when learn to live with its past, like Germany democratic learned to live with yours and we are also asking to it.

As regards the authorities in Ankara have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, we can make significant progress: the island can be reunited and tomorrow it will be an overall regulation fair, lasting and comply with international law.
</seg>
<seg id=882>
Really, why not includes all this in the report of the European Commission?
</seg>
<seg id=883>
This is the balanced framework in which we must resolutely continue with our action to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id=884>
If we address the Armenian issue in the context of accession to the EU - and please listen carefully to what I say: if we address the Armenian issue in the context of accession to the EU - the draft which we are debating today will not start; it is as simple as that.
</seg>
<seg id=885>
Moreover, it is also the reason for our insistence of carrying out an assessment of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, precisely, we will be able to establish the necessary guidelines.
</seg>
<seg id=886>
However, we have managed to keep the dialogue, and sometimes on sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, migration, human rights, for example.
</seg>
<seg id=887>
In addition, the Council has made an effort, especially since 1995, by providing the Mediterranean most important means, to the extent of the challenges of the partnership.
</seg>
<seg id=888>
This is, in fact, a matter of extraordinary importance and I would like to say, as the central European.
</seg>
<seg id=889>
Mr President, as you know, in English it says that when the star does not appear in a role is, as a representation of Hamlet without first enterrador.

We want to see a pooling of policies on issues relating to the single market and agree to introduce the cumulation of origin together with regional free-trade agreements so that all the partners relations remain free trade amongst themselves and adopt the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.
</seg>
<seg id=891>
We have learned with satisfaction that the Commission is prepared to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process.
</seg>
<seg id=892>
I have highlighted these aspects in them because we need to find the key to relaunch the process, and it is worth mentioning here the extension of the political agenda of Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id=893>
Therefore, it must be our priority the guarantee peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every effort for the sake of this cooperation and ensure that commitments are implemented effectively, depending on the - let us say - selfish generosity of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=894>
These are important issues and specific which I would like to raise, and I would like to thank Mr Brok which has authorised this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission to discuss these issues.
</seg>
<seg id=895>
The world is moving towards a globalisation unstoppable and in this context it is necessary to be organised in large blocs to act as protagonists in the great jigsaw of global competition.

It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have requested just barely a quarter of the EUR 4,700 million allocated for the MEDA I programme, which expired in 1999.
</seg>
<seg id=897>
For this positive is the proposal for a new impetus which the Commission has made, and we agree fully with the two priorities which marked Mr Patten in their speeches and reiterated here this evening.
</seg>
<seg id=898>
It is a wake-up call for the European Union to play a more active role in the Mediterranean area that historically and culturally and enriqueció engrandeció our European continent.

The media in that region have been responsible often tragedy which has lived and are necessary resources completely free and to act in accordance with the rules that exist in our democracies.

Also, I am lucky because I believe that Parliament has succeeded in achieving to return to a situation which originally was not as good as has maintained a continuous pressure.
</seg>
<seg id=905>
I say again: it is absolutely essential to avoid unnecessary costs in meetings unnecessary.

<seg id=906>
However, we must not focus solely on Kosovo.

It is also unfortunate that a number of programmes are in the so-called reserve for action ", opførselsreserven" .

What initiatives will adopt the Presidency of the Council, as requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, to play a more active role in order to ensure the application total and absolute of the UN peace plan?
</seg>
<seg id=913>
How to achieve this new impetus without the resolution of this conflict? we know the close links between the European Union and Morocco, particularly between France and Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=914>
I can simply point out that France and Germany - here I am not speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - mentioned these matters in the course of a bilateral Summit in Vittel, last week, and it was decided to set up a working group in order to remedy the problem.
</seg>
<seg id=915>
At the same time, the Union continues to provide material support to these two important countries, through the intermediary of its various programmes, especially TACIS.
</seg>
<seg id=916>
The honourable Member' s question gives, then, to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel certain confusion.
</seg>
<seg id=917>
I will add one further clarification: it is particularly in these two texts, to strengthen the criminal framework for combating the organised networks of smugglers.
</seg>
<seg id=918>
In the report that the Council of Ministers Turkish adopted on 21 September as reform programme, appear on the part of the legislative changes several projects: included on the civil code measures to strengthen the equality of men and women in areas The the fight the best against the violence family; better condemn these acts of violence by creating specialist judges in the field of family and, finally, to ban the possibility of a reduced penalties for crime of honour.

Therefore, the Presidency should not have to give an answer on this point.

President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici - which says that in order to make progress on the association of Turkey and the European Union, it is not possible to take into account the Cyprus issue?

We must bear in mind that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than just a fisheries agreement and that, as he knows, if we do not come to this agreement, bearing in mind what this means, this could conceal a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.
</seg>
<seg id=925>
Therefore, I must express my scepticism about the outcome.
</seg>
<seg id=926>
With regard to the application of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should allow the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of the rights of individuals.

Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 d on the oil supply of the European Union, states that wishes to table at the Gothenburg European Council, a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources which should help to strengthen energy efficiency, especially in buildings and transport.

<seg id=929>
In this spirit, we, as a result of the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, on 9 November, call on the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies which defend human rights.

The leaders agreed a framework 2000 broadened and updated cooperation between Asia and Europe which is the work programme for the forthcoming decade.
</seg>
<seg id=941>
In my opinion these issues remind us of the important role that Europe represents in Asia, not only in economic terms and trade, although it should be noted that one of the reasons for the recovery of Asia is that we have kept our word to maintain open our markets to exports from Asia over the past two years.
</seg>
<seg id=942>
I believe that we have made an excellent political declaration, but still remain to be resolved some problems.
</seg>
<seg id=943>
We know that the Commission takes very seriously ASEM and we fully support this institution as far as that is concerned.
</seg>
<seg id=944>
There is a need to improve the existing mechanisms in the transposition of Community law, to increase legal certainty and overcome its current slow.
</seg>
<seg id=945>
Why should promote the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already Community presence, as in the case of the Western Pacific and the South Pacific.
</seg>
<seg id=946>
This will make a real contribution to that fisheries are sustainable.
</seg>
<seg id=947>
I believe that the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, there are few. to defend the position of the United Nations, both in the 1982 Convention and in New York, to which reference has been made here, we must have a presence very active in these organisations for responsible fishing.
</seg>
<seg id=948>
That is why I believe that the Commission has a very important role to encourage fishermen to be at the forefront, cooperate with it and propose a solution with which we are all agreed.
</seg>
<seg id=949>
In addition, the Commission must take on all kinds of tasks in connection with the negotiations that have taken place in the context of regional fisheries organisations.
</seg>
<seg id=950>
Mr President, I have the same problem that Nicholson, but in my case is even more serious.
</seg>
<seg id=951>
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions recommended by the Committee on Agriculture and rural development.

<seg id=952>
Sometimes we have come to ask ourselves to what extent the crisis itself cyclical market is not caused by the speculative action of these business structures, so that by ensuring that the control of the sector according to their interests.

<seg id=953>
The extra aid Community raised in Mr Garot' s report is, in my view, contrary to all sanity in recent years, although with Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe we must reform our agricultural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=954>
We intend to introduce an insurance scheme and it is clear that is based on social criteria, in my opinion, the rapporteur has done an excellent job which shows that the Administration is much stake when it pursues a purpose clearly defined, as is the case.
</seg>
<seg id=955>
On the one hand, producers more important, or those who are integrated with companies producing not, this device, preferring to systems that are already: savings individual loans, compensation fund.
</seg>
<seg id=956>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say in advance that in principle I welcome the Commission' s proposal to create a fund regulation, also in the context of the Austrian agriculture.
</seg>
<seg id=957>
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
</seg>
<seg id=958>
I understand that you want a market organisation for holding intensive and the collapse of the agricultural policy when it is linked to the land, when we are talking about an extensive production.
</seg>
<seg id=959>
There is already an organisation of markets and we should not make the mistake of calling into question the organisation of existing markets, since in general terms has the desired effect.
</seg>
<seg id=960>
In the opinion of the Commission is fully justified that only require greater rigour farmers participating in the Fund regulation, since after all they receive a stable income in exchange, while those which do not belong do not receive any compensation.
</seg>
<seg id=961>
(The sitting was closed at 23.10 p.m.)

<seg id=962>
The appeal from VAT accounted for 36% and traditional own resources amounted to 15% of the total.
</seg>
<seg id=963>
Another element of the reform corresponds faithfully with one of the key priorities identified by the Court is the need to attach greater importance to the measurement of the results and the action within a framework of allocation of resources which is consistent with the priorities and the predetermined objectives that are clearly defined and can be measured.
</seg>
<seg id=964>
This is good and I thank him sincerely, Mr Karlsson, like the members of the Court of Auditors and also their services, the support given to the reform of the Commission in its report.
</seg>
<seg id=965>
In this context and given its proximity, I too would like to remind you that, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed an amendment to the Treaty to allow for the creation of a European public prosecutor responsible for prosecuting fraud to the detriment of the Community' s financial interests. I sincerely hope that the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice is not limited to take note of the proposal or to scrap but it discussed seriously.
</seg>
<seg id=966>
The reality, as the describes the annual report, it is rather disappointing.
</seg>
<seg id=967>
The number of errors identified is too high in order to provide this guarantee.

The amount earmarked for activities planning fell well short by EUR 240 million.

<seg id=971>
The Commission and the Member States should look from this angle and use the results of the report as a tool to improve their performance in the management of the European Union' s finances.
</seg>
<seg id=972>
I know that this report and the role which is about to embark Parliament in the context of the discharge will contribute to increasing vigilance with regard to Community expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=973>
And at this moment, Madam President, I would like to keep quiet and hope that someone from the Council come here.
</seg>
<seg id=974>
The Court, as in other years, has not said exactly where there have been failures.
</seg>
<seg id=975>
Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union and on the Court of Auditors' report makes it clear that there must be a hard work in the applicant countries.
</seg>
<seg id=976>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, recently came to an agreement with the Court of Auditors for which we could receive information from the Court of Auditors in advance with absolutely nature confidential and also agreed that we would retain the effectively in silence.
</seg>
<seg id=977>
I would also like to address the Council and ask why no progress is being made with regard to Article 24 of the Financial Regulation.
</seg>
<seg id=978>
It may be that a bit of common sense of the European Union should contribute to the resolution of the problem and to put George Bush at the place of history that deserves - just the dustbin!
</seg>
<seg id=979>
We must not look for scapegoats, nor in our institutions and in our Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=980>
Firstly, with regard to the procedure presentation of the annual report to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary control, I am pleased to hear the words reassuring honourable Members to the effect that the situation this year is more satisfactory than in previous years.
</seg>
<seg id=981>
But we will have an opportunity to discuss it.
</seg>
<seg id=982>
When is important from the point of view of taxation, we mention everything that needs to be mentioned.
</seg>
<seg id=983>
Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the final part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has suffered the consequences of the intrusion of a virus malhadado between his speech and this House.
</seg>
<seg id=984>
Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18, relating to issues that relate mainly to the United Kingdom and it must be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, are Socialists, popular or the Greens have defended with great vehemence and have been adopted in the Environment Committee.
</seg>
<seg id=985>
Mr President, in March of this year we adopted the directive on the tramways intended for the transport of persons.
</seg>
<seg id=986>
We believe that must not be to pass on trade obligations producer laid down in the legislation relating to the safety of products.
</seg>
<seg id=987>
We have heard the justifications for them and also in favour of repeating the arguments of the sector since that that committee.
</seg>
<seg id=988>
Should be enough with the seller report the buyer on the nature of the products and on the scant information provided on them.
</seg>
<seg id=989>
Lastly, a question to the Commission in relation to Article 4 with regard to European standards and to the question of whether these rules should be made public.
</seg>
<seg id=990>
I am pleased with the exceptions to include establishments institutions and organisations charitable not-for-profit, and for the articles which are marketed as second-hand products in car boot sales or by private individuals.
</seg>
<seg id=991>
The reliability in the safety of products and assistance after-sales are a more added value for the European label in a moment particularly difficult and decisive.
</seg>
<seg id=992>
When in another context call upon the Commission to present a proposal on the safety of services, it is incomprehensible now that that that regulate jointly aspects relating to services, rather than waiting for the Commission to present its proposal; in fact, already been can foresee that problems will arise demarcation of the scope of the various rules and legal uncertainty will increase over time.
</seg>
<seg id=993>
I would like to say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=994>
We have also given the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular, the candidate countries: the simplification of procedures to introduce emergency measures at Community level, so that we can intervene promptly following the opinion of a regulatory committee.
</seg>
<seg id=995>
This new requirement does not imply any responsibility substantial additional in the case of this type of shops.
</seg>
<seg id=996>
Replacing the term "producer" with "provider" , as proposed in amendment No 11, would create more confusion than clarity, since there is no definition of providers in the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=997>
Although the Commission is in favour of the creation as soon as possible a network, this point must be agreed between the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=998>
Such a certificate can always be used to provide evidence, but it cannot be considered in itself as a litmus test.
</seg>
<seg id=999>
Having explained in detail the reasons why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and part of amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, because they are an improvement and clarification of the Commission' s proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1000>
Of course, to Mr Barón Crespo, if it is Italian Socialist cannot be part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
</seg>
<seg id=1001>
I believe that there is no conflict between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.
</seg>
<seg id=1002>
With regard to the order of voting, I leave it to the President' s decision, and I would point out that, in any case, I am against the three amendments.
</seg>
<seg id=1003>
The Mediterranean countries from outside are, of course, problems particularly serious relating to economic development. regional inequalities are acrecientan endlessly.
</seg>
<seg id=1004>
With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, for the sake of a European policy harmonised immigration, in addition to the legal instruments to ensure their fair treatment, create instruments for financial support for all those young people who, having completed a cycle of higher studies or university in European countries, wish to return to their country of origin to start to exercise a profession.
</seg>
<seg id=1005>
I would like to emphasise a factor, which I consider to be very decisive in this matter; the lack of equality in the workplace.
</seg>
<seg id=1006>
Although belatedly, the Commission presented the programme relating to the Community framework strategy on equality between men and women (2001-2005), which strays markedly from its predecessors and, in particular, the fourth action programme which expires at the end of this year.
</seg>
<seg id=1007>
On the one hand, because they have taken account of various proposals for improvements tabled by my group and, on the other, because it insists on the need to review the situation of women in the national labour markets and the inadequate access to social security systems on the basis of statistics gathered from data of broken down according to gender.
</seg>
<seg id=1008>
Mr President, my party has serious reservations with regard to apply Community law to the sale of consumer products, as regards the refusal to implement the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
</seg>
<seg id=1009>
Now understand it and the amendments labour offer the guarantee that these shops remain intact and will be exempt from the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1010>
Finally, amendment No 15 makes it a free hand to the Commission with regard to the language regime of the agency, which we consider to be very worrying.
</seg>
<seg id=1011>
The simplification of the decision-making procedures, the creation of bases operations of not only in Pristina, where it has acquired the meaning of its separation of Yugoslavia), the treatment of the dual structure between the management board and the Commission, can be positive movements in the direction of tackling the great bureaucratic inadequacy of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
</seg>
<seg id=1012>
We are therefore voting against both the Commission proposal and Parliament' s report.
</seg>
<seg id=1013>
Therefore, it seems reasonable to adapt Community rules in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1014>
Furthermore, the fund offers the possibility of administrations grant aid more or less hidden in the form of cofinancing by the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1015>
- (EL) despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is undoubtedly more advanced that the Commission' s proposal as regards the partnership European Union - Ôurquía.
</seg>
<seg id=1016>
We have voted against.
</seg>
<seg id=1017>
Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress in some respects and that there are positive signs.
</seg>
<seg id=1018>
Since 1987 this House had started the path of recognition, and the adoption of this amendment demonstrates the coherence of Parliament in this debate.
</seg>
<seg id=1019>
The Union must make more proposals and consider enlargement to include Turkey as a strategy geopolitical indispensable.
</seg>
<seg id=1020>
These ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.
</seg>
<seg id=1021>
For several years, as a member of the Delegation for relations with Canada, I noticed the operation of one of these regional organisations, the OPANO (Organisation of fishing in the Northwest Atlantic), involving the countries of this region, including Canada, and all those who use in this place traditional fishing areas, including France, Spain and other European countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1022>
It is not content until its fleet, cañoneras fly the flags of the "ring of stars" , to monitor compliance with its fisheries policies.
</seg>
<seg id=1023>
What matters is not, therefore, to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission and weaken the position of Europe, which would be in contradiction with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity.
</seg>
<seg id=1024>
Finally, following difficult negotiations, we reached a result worth defending.
</seg>
<seg id=1025>
Thus, the aim of this proposal seeking to replace three directives on waste incineration is to improve the quality of air, water, soil, people' s health, reducing emissions of pollutants linked to the activities of incineration and co-incineration and, above all, dioxins and furans heavy metals.
</seg>
<seg id=1026>
However, I also think it is important to stress as novelty now that it is no longer merely emissions into the atmosphere but also of emissions to water and land.
</seg>
<seg id=1027>
The proposal has been improved during its preparation.
</seg>
<seg id=1028>
The introduction of limits much more strict NOx emissions for new installations co-incineration, such as cement kilns, is another step forward which will serve as the incentive for reducing emissions, despite the fact that the proposed rules do not reflect best available techniques.
</seg>
<seg id=1029>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise - especially Mr Blokland, for having arrived a few minutes late.
</seg>
<seg id=1030>
In conclusion, this directive is an important contribution to reducing the harmful effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.
</seg>
<seg id=1031>
The European Parliament is to be met, on behalf of discrimination and the fight against the exclusions and on respect for the individual responsibilities, to give a strong boost to the creation of a mechanism which will enable there is specifically the essential principle of solidarity.

There are, however, big differences between the various countries of the Union, and there is a lack of statistical data detailed comparable to see convincing proof of what is in force in each country, what is - and where - what works better, what the weaknesses are, etc. it is precisely for this reason, in my opinion, drafted on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary policy, underlines the need, before legislating Community rules on insurance supplementary disease, for the Commission to draw up a green paper to collect and sistematice all these data now dispersed and all the information on this.
</seg>
<seg id=1033>
Until now, this matter has been considered taboo to some extent.
</seg>
<seg id=1034>
There is a danger that due to the presence of serious risks people with health problems and elderly people just can take out insurance private limited, which is incompatible with social development.
</seg>
<seg id=1035>
The second point of view illustrated by the original intention of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues is to promote regulations and codes of conduct necessary to introduce, between insurers, forms of mutualización costs - guaranteeing all the provision of health care good quality - and to avoid the risk of develop discriminatory practices, as well as a selection of risks and clients.
</seg>
<seg id=1036>
I think it is quite wrong that the money will be the determining factor to be first in line.
</seg>
<seg id=1037>
The new proposal from the Committee on employment and social affairs we think it is right: firstly be drawn up an inventory in a Green Paper and then decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation.
</seg>
<seg id=1038>
At present, in the Netherlands is taking place a debate on the introduction of structural changes in the system.
</seg>
<seg id=1039>
This is the basis of which was the basis of the Commission to produce an initiative and articulate test specific may become guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1040>
Therefore, it is unlikely that the answer is a single solution and absolute for all medical insurance.
</seg>
<seg id=1041>
I therefore believe that we must focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard, whom we congratulate, which calls on the Commission the provision of a service, a Green Paper which will allow us to be aware of the current state of insurance in the Member States and also define the future.
</seg>
<seg id=1042>
Both are on a model based on three pillars: the State, the business and private.
</seg>
<seg id=1043>
As regards supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced a series of rules. has done so through the drafting of a Green Paper has shown a draft directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1044>
Mr President, I would like to express my thanks and congratulations to Mr Rocard for his report and congratulate Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1045>
This study will form the basis for a Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament to propose initiatives or measures.
</seg>
<seg id=1046>
In relation to the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can say with pleasure that all have been incorporated.
</seg>
<seg id=1047>
We have supported the characteristic features of the programme, such as the multidimensional treatment of the phenomenon, measures on health, education, housing, consistency and complementarity with other policies related, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, and our own people affected by social exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=1048>
This means that we must seize stages bottom-up cycle to restore the situation to a balance or surplus.
</seg>
<seg id=1049>
In this regard simply remind you that the Ecofin Council has requested of the Commission that, as from next year, be included in the assessment of the stability programmes precisely this aspect of long-term public finances on the ageing of the population.
</seg>
<seg id=1050>
One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands is the special attention which provides - as I said earlier - the impact of the ageing of the population in public finances over the next few years.
</seg>
<seg id=1051>
For that reason, the resulting budget for the year 2000, in the German case, will provide a situation of surplus a point and a half the gross domestic product.
</seg>
<seg id=1052>
If we add to this the development of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have had a clear negative impact in terms of inflation.
</seg>
<seg id=1053>
Also move in the direction of reconcile a public system of distribution systems with private capitalisation and, of course, are compatible with support for the creation of investment fund specific can obtain tax advantages in the long term and which can help to deal with the problem of ageing.
</seg>
<seg id=1054>
The third principle that guides us, then, is the precautionary principle.
</seg>
<seg id=1055>
It should be remembered that are currently under discussion several proposals regulations, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore, I hope, the confidence of consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=1056>
However, this effect relatively low is no reason to be satisfied.
</seg>
<seg id=1057>
Frankly, I was disappointed that in the statement made yesterday that Prime Minister Jospin there were no recognition of the positive role played by the Community in recent years.
</seg>
<seg id=1058>
There is a clear need to find explanations to the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1059>
The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission already gives absolute priority to controls in the Member States in connection with protection measures against BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1060>
With regard to their security, let me repeat that there is already a wide range of controls in place to ensure that animal meal do not represent a threat from BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1061>
Yes, though it may be difficult to believe, it took four years to adopt a measure that I consider it essential for the protection of public health.
</seg>
<seg id=1062>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like expressly to demand that the Council made public, at last, its opinion on the regulation on BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1063>
In this situation, the only way to break the circle of transmission of BSE is the total ban on using meat-and-bone meal in animal feed.
</seg>
<seg id=1064>
In this regard, I would like to say that the Liberal Group has tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted.
</seg>
<seg id=1065>
Policies have to change this state of affairs so that the real culprits of this crisis are penalised and for specific decisions to allow a first step in order to put an end to this dramatic crisis.
</seg>
<seg id=1066>
We should, therefore, that revisarlos.
</seg>
<seg id=1067>
The labelling of beef which has been adopted, which is a minimum labelling and which has been in force for just two and a half months not, properly, the origin of the animals and have banned very late specified risk materials.
</seg>
<seg id=1068>
The public must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test I have referred to.
</seg>
<seg id=1069>
At that time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, did nothing or almost nothing, as their counterparts nor did nothing about the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, nothing about the contaminated blood, provided for the same reason: not to cause panic among the public.
</seg>
<seg id=1070>
The French ban will lead to an enormous increase in demand, but stocks of this products are limited.
</seg>
<seg id=1071>
Consumers have lost confidence, and to contain this phenomenon is necessary to generalise the BSE tests to cattle and sheep.
</seg>
<seg id=1072>
In the direction of the Commission proposal now is far more important to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.
</seg>
<seg id=1073>
Moreover, I fully agree - for once and just this once - with regard have said the ladies and gentlemen, Ainardi Auroi and Mrs Grossetête.
</seg>
<seg id=1074>
Well, gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, have a financial basis enough to carry out a sound policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1075>
We must tackle it. Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1076>
Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here, within this Chamber, that, come what may, we must change the CAP.
</seg>
<seg id=1077>
We have already denounced in due course, right here, with Jimmy Goldsmith.
</seg>
<seg id=1078>
Food must be a food safe for human beings.
</seg>
<seg id=1079>
I think it is very exemplary that France has been quick to take this step.
</seg>
<seg id=1080>
But that these are not helping them!
</seg>
<seg id=1081>
For this reason, I am surprised that in these circumstances we continue to be able to use or processing carcasses.
</seg>
<seg id=1082>
Recently has been published in the UK the Phillips report on BSE.
</seg>
<seg id=1083>
I would suggest that the European Commission also apply the precautionary principle with regard to beef in France.
</seg>
<seg id=1084>
We need to know today because we continue in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures to be taken.
</seg>
<seg id=1085>
Moreover, I have heard all these proposals; I am not insensitive to them.
</seg>
<seg id=1086>
If representatives of the Member States come and tell me that legislation has not been implemented in its entirety, perhaps we should rethink the subject, but we shall not do so because scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because there are gaps in compliance with the law in the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1087>
The best way of not hear us is not invite us; in any event, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1088>
The Commission considers that for the clarification and the coordination of these policies readmission agreements play an important role and are currently under negotiation in the first Community agreements on readmission with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.

</seg>
<seg id=1090>

The aim during this period has been reducing the public deficit to achieve a monetary policy policy policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.

However, it is not obvious, since the new growth is very desigualitario and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States since some ten years ago, for persistent phenomena of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty, urban ghettización.
</seg>
<seg id=1097>
The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, which is also truth is something simple and too commonplace.
</seg>
<seg id=1098>
In the atmosphere hostile establishing, many people are on the way and are rejected.
</seg>
<seg id=1099>
Mr President, in this House, we hear all too often, like a mantra, the glorification of the European social model, of the social market economy which must be set with pride - as many speakers - think the savage model of the United States.
</seg>
<seg id=1100>

</seg>
<seg id=1101>
This is a huge amount.
</seg>
<seg id=1102>
Furthermore, they must be incorporated all political levels.

<seg id=1103>
I agree on the need to have a better understanding of the causes of poverty, support the preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, industrial change, relocations, rural desertification, hiperconcentración urban, with speeches innovative and practical involving the participation of social partners, local authorities and national and joint action by the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=1104>
There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of the social reforms and structural.
</seg>
<seg id=1105>
This is a problem of legal nature, since, according to the wording of the Treaty, we can only the reference to social exclusion and not to poverty.
</seg>
<seg id=1106>
In my opinion, these proposals are a pragmatic response to your question.
</seg>
<seg id=1107>
But agree on the strategy does not necessarily mean coincide in the detail.
</seg>
<seg id=1108>
If we define a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the various systems that have to meet such requirements must have a trial period longer.
</seg>
<seg id=1109>
Renewable energies will not be a panacea for solving this problem, but there is no doubt that, in large part, can help to improve the situation and also diversifying energy sources and to reduce our dependence on hydrocarbons, which furthermore would not at all bad.
</seg>
<seg id=1110>
I shall repeat three of our demands.
</seg>
<seg id=1111>
The establishment objectives of undoubtedly to increase people' s confidence in energy policy to be applied.
</seg>
<seg id=1112>
I believe that a vigorous policy in the field of renewable energy sources is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.
</seg>
<seg id=1113>
Finally, these agreements should allow European countries to fulfil its contribution to achieving the targets set in Kyoto.
</seg>
<seg id=1114>
It is regrettable that preclude any category that can contribute to achieving the general objective of recovering energy from waste - whether it is small-scale projects as if it is a part of the total calculation.

<seg id=1115>

I would like to inform Mr Chichester that off the coast of my people are setting up quickly windmills at sea, a project that certainly is going to come into operation in a very short time, so I would like to invite you to see it when it has been set in motion.
</seg>
<seg id=1117>
The controversy on the renunciation of nuclear energy, for example in Sweden and Germany, has revealed that unless there are on the horizon alternative energy ecological practicable at a competitive price, the debate is doomed to failure.
</seg>
<seg id=1118>
For this reason, Member States must be given binding targets.
</seg>
<seg id=1119>
Therefore, I am optimistic about the future potential for renewable energies, provided that provide the necessary incentives.
</seg>
<seg id=1120>
I think that we need a great deal of courage to put constantly to renewable energy sources in the place they deserve.
</seg>
<seg id=1121>
A very strong rise in oil prices, certainly puts us with greater brutality to the problems associated with our dependence on fossil energy sources.
</seg>
<seg id=1122>
We cannot therefore accept amendment No 28.
</seg>
<seg id=1123>
However, in doing so, the Commission is well aware that the terms used not prejudge its right of initiative and must be incompatible with the single market in electricity.

Also Portugal, where women did not have access to diplomacy to "revolution in April 1974" , has demonstrated recently, in the case of East Timor and our ambassador in Indonesia, Ana Gomes, that the role of a woman and his sensitivity to the problems and the suffering of a people that faced alone a fight 25 years for freedom can be ways throughout the world and, in particular, here in the European Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1130>
To date, very few Member States have done so.
</seg>
<seg id=1131>
It is therefore necessary to take into account this dimension when preparing the policies of the European Union in the future.
</seg>
<seg id=1132>
Unfortunately, it is not appropriate to define the concepts or distinctions are made.

In this way, Europe has shown the vitality of its civilisation, within the framework of world history, and their ability political imagination of its future development.

It is clear that the issue of the situation in Kosovo is a problem of democracy.

On the other hand, we would like to have the opportunity to demonstrate to Europe that we are capable of developing the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia by our own resources, through the recognition of the real principles of democracy.

I must say that, when we listen, I impresioné much for the way in which you controlled such a difficult situation, and at the same time on its determination.

Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions allows citizens to monitor the governing bodies of the EU and encourages greater efficiency.
</seg>
<seg id=1148>
I believe that a fifth amendment important is the annual report should examine particularly documents which need to be secret or, at least, are kept secret.
</seg>
<seg id=1149>
This issue is ambiguous, and it is also possible to enter and remain in force more restrictive rules, so we have tabled amendments on this point, among others.

<seg id=1150>
The Committee on Foreign Affairs rejected the idea of exempting of transparency, and automatically group, to documents relating to foreign affairs and security.

<seg id=1153>
I am pleased that Parliament has managed to create a broad majority in favour of greater openness.
</seg>
<seg id=1154>
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for this excellent work.
</seg>
<seg id=1155>
Mr President, access and transparency in the European Union do not enjoy good reputation.
</seg>
<seg id=1156>
If so, then there is something amiss, because it is the credibility and reliability of the European Union for the citizen.
</seg>
<seg id=1157>
Documents are much today and we would like to ensure that there is the widest possible access to those different types of documents from the most varied ways possible.
</seg>
<seg id=1158>
Mr President, the Commission' s position with regard to public access to documents can be seen in the manual internal was sent on 11 October employees of the Commission to inform you of how to handle applications for public access to documents submitted by Members of the European Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1159>
This provision must be eliminated or, at least, so enlarged to include consideration of assessing the interests of the applicant.
</seg>
<seg id=1160>
The usual way in which develops cooperation at international level with the rules of the game and practices of diplomacy, namely that everything is carried out with the screens reductions, there is no point in the modern cooperation which has developed the EU.

<seg id=1161>
Should not be confused with the role of the European Parliament or with the future interinstitutional agreements.
</seg>
<seg id=1162>
I believe that we have taken a step forward towards the exercise of the right of citizens to information and knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1163>
However, it is not the only he whom I thank, many thanks are also deserves Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen of the PPE-DE Group, which was the author of the motion under a strict application of the Hughes procedure.
</seg>
<seg id=1164>
Transparency must establish itself as a basic pillar of all activities of the Union, but the right of access to documents is not yet sufuciente itself for the completion of transparency.

<seg id=1165>
The European Parliament asks, then, that the European security and defence policy is introduced in the future in the structures of the European Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1166>
When addressed Parliament, on 3 October last, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and referred to that in a European system based on checks and balances, fluidity of the operation of each institution contributes to the common interest.
</seg>
<seg id=1167>
I must admit that the great challenge in this regulation is the precise definition of the documents.
</seg>
<seg id=1168>
I would like to stress that, in its time, practically, the Commission could accept all the amendments, such as the 9, 18, 21 in part, 23, 25, 26,1, 28 (F), 35, 38, 40,1, 40,6, 41,1, 42, 43,1, 47, 49 and 52.
</seg>
<seg id=1169>
I sometimes vote in favour of the proposals put forward by the Commission, and that means in fact that Members have the list of amendments that the Commission can support and the list of those who do not want to support.
</seg>
<seg id=1170>
Capital base of banks
</seg>
<seg id=1171>
Finally, and most controversial, the committee gave a strong call for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.
</seg>
<seg id=1172>
These amendments replace several other proposals in the report which will probably be rejected in the vote and they will then be substituidas for these new amendments resulting from this consensus.
</seg>
<seg id=1173>
Mr President, in view of the excellent vote of support for this report and given the response from the Commission this morning, it is obvious - if you look at all the parts on which we voted - that, under Article 2 (69) of the Rules of procedure, we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution to initiate fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1174>
Mr President, I am sorry if I said that the PPE-DE Group had also requested that the vote be postponed, but its coordinator is acercó me and told me that they also wanted to postpone the matter until the part-session in November II, rather than voting now.
</seg>
<seg id=1175>
Why would suggest that we postpone the vote is that - as Mr Goebbels stated - this is a very important issue.
</seg>
<seg id=1176>
I do not know how much it costs the roll-call vote, but it is certainly of hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.
</seg>
<seg id=1177>
I know that in France have been slaughtered entire herds and do not believe that this is the best way forward.

Removing meal of animal feeding all animals, not just the cattle and sheep, but also the pig, poultry and fish,
</seg>
<seg id=1179>
This is not acceptable.

<seg id=1180>
It is on provisions such as consumers will be reassured and farmers hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey to you.
</seg>
<seg id=1181>
There is a pressing need to go further: promoting a change of the common agricultural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1182>
The ban on the use of animal meal in animal feed is merely the first step in this direction.
</seg>
<seg id=1183>
We very much regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our Group were not adopted.
</seg>
<seg id=1184>
I think it would be sensible to reduce the working hours of people working in companies that pollute.
</seg>
<seg id=1185>
I shall conclude by insisting once again on the fact that the generalisation of exploitation of hazardous waste must not lead us to adapt to the production of such waste.

<seg id=1186>
Indeed, if, for example, had larger pensions enough to live, there would be less poor.
</seg>
<seg id=1187>
The report raises a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.
</seg>
<seg id=1188>
I therefore give my unreserved support to the proposal to set up a Luxembourg process (A) in the field of social exclusion, which includes guidelines and national action plans.
</seg>
<seg id=1189>
Indeed, the report calls for an annual qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.
</seg>
<seg id=1190>
In presenting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is complying with the request of the Council to submit "for June 2000" a "initiative for cooperation in this field" .
</seg>
<seg id=1191>
Mr President, I abstained on a very specific reason: this report, in my view, has not done from the ecological point of view, these progress that I hoped and auguraba.
</seg>
<seg id=1192>
I trust that this system is extended to all the cities of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1193>
Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot count on my support.

The next item is firstly the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
</seg>
<seg id=1197>
These three reasons are as follows: firstly, because makes the process of consolidating democracy and the deepening of the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous populations.
</seg>
<seg id=1198>
Mr President, in this debate we express, as well as has been said by other speakers on the floor, solidarity and support of our institution the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting for maintaining the priority in the area of the European Union' s external relations with the countries of Latin America.
</seg>
<seg id=1199>
I have no reservations which he has been able to express our colleague and friend, the chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, on the question of human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1200>
Finally, in the dialogue with the authorities centroamericanas, the Commission is also by reiterating the importance to be given to the process of regional integration as an instrument for consolidating the democratisation and development in the area.
</seg>
<seg id=1201>
To cling to power has not hesitated to grab the obsessive debate on "marfilidad" , causing a wave of xenophobia: hatred of other abroad, the original Burkina or the Malian and yet there are many people working and living in the territory of Côte d'Ivoire for many years.

<seg id=1202>
The establishment of a true democracy in Côte d'Ivoire cannot be done without the creation of an independent commission of inquiry of the crimes committed and without the formal commitment to respect human rights and civil peace.

Some believe that the importance of democracy is on when it comes to Africa, which are complex procedures, which must be given time at the time, but I believe that no compromise is possible with democracy and the question being asked today to Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that arises for example in Guinea, when we know today that there are people in prison and that there is a democratic system.
</seg>
<seg id=1204>
I shall conclude with the following question: dictatorships exist, Mr President, just because there are people who suffer from misery, who have no access to know, who have no access to knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1205>
It would be illogical that the European Union demand today the holding of new presidential elections in which could participate, this time, all the candidates.
</seg>
<seg id=1206>
This is in many parts of Africa with the most diverse mixtures religious and ethnic.
</seg>
<seg id=1207>
These elections must allow representation at national level of the political parties that are excluded in the presidential election and compensate for this, if only partially, the imperfections of this first choice.
</seg>
<seg id=1208>
On the situation in Burma
</seg>
<seg id=1209>
They are doing a great offensive against the Shan people and against the Karen people and, as said the rapporteur of the UN, there is no sign whatsoever of dialogue between the SPDC and the national League for Democracy.
</seg>
<seg id=1210>
Therefore, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
</seg>
<seg id=1211>
I hope that by giving priority to this issue as a matter of urgency, this Parliament will send a clear message to the people of Burma that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in Burma is getting worse rather than better and we are determined to try to do something about it.
</seg>
<seg id=1212>
It has been a long time be achieved.
</seg>
<seg id=1213>
In Asia precisely there is a danger that economic reforms and policies is desacoplen, that may have economic progress and economic liberalisation without liberalisation in the political sphere and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that without a constitutional state that functions, trade, aid and investment will have been lost in the long term.
</seg>
<seg id=1214>
Mr President, I agree with my predecessors on the floor with many essential points to what has been said, because much of what is now happening in Vietnam is not acceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=1215>
However, now says human Rights Watch, referred to Mr Swoboda, that Vietnam gave at the last time some steps to improve the situation regarding human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1216>
These documents extremely secret provide us with a strange look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1217>
The Commission remains convinced, however, that can only be achieved a lasting solution to the current situation through a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition democratically elected and representatives of ethnic minorities.
</seg>
<seg id=1218>
There are also clear pressure by the Vietnamese authorities to its own press has a regime of self-censorship.
</seg>
<seg id=1219>
The next item, I must now the debate on the following motions for resolutions:
</seg>
<seg id=1220>
Also we demand that the EU give aid and assistance, not only in the south-west but in all areas that have been affected.
</seg>
<seg id=1221>
I would ask you all to support our resolution.
</seg>
<seg id=1222>
It is urgent that the Union is not restricted to deploy actions character of disasters have occurred.
</seg>
<seg id=1223>
The Commission has taken two initiatives in this respect.
</seg>
<seg id=1224>
Mr President, there has been an error purely linguistic by introducing one of the amendments in the joint resolution.
</seg>
<seg id=1225>
The vote on your participation means postponing the task to the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1226>
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
</seg>
<seg id=1227>
The report is based on the fact that an ever increasing proportion of the insurance in Europe is covered by insurance complementary.
</seg>
<seg id=1228>
I think it is odd that wants to be it is to the Commission for a proposal for a directive, but at the same time ask him a Green Paper on the current state of the voluntary associations and medical insurance complementary.
</seg>
<seg id=1229>
At a time when the ageing population dramatically, it is crucial that we try to improve the health system for people throughout Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1230>
We could not contribute to this.
</seg>
<seg id=1231>
Mr President, there are strong arguments in favour of the fast track when it comes to implementing the results of the review of Basel on capital adequacy banking.
</seg>
<seg id=1232>
Under these conditions, such an initiative would rather the opposite effect to the expected to impose our banking sectors additional obligations without guarantees compensation. despite the orders of this House, the Commission does not have any means of guaranteeing that the banks of the European Union will no longer be subject to discriminatory treatment by the American authorities.
</seg>
<seg id=1233>
We must take care that Basle, moreover, does not produce that banks will cause a second ballast demand a higher capital.
</seg>
<seg id=1234>
This first comment, I should like to point out that I believe that economic operators also consider satisfactory the approach which has been giving these regulations on capital which reinforce the issues relating to risk.
</seg>
<seg id=1235>
These are the first thoughts of how we could achieve a legislative process quickly that outside controllable and efficient within the current rules of the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=1236>
And, indeed, the time has come to admit that the institution of the "European Ombudsman" is sufficiently developed and has already given sufficient proof of maturity in order to have its own budget.
</seg>
<seg id=1237>
The EPP group/ED supports the position of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Ombudsman' s mandate should be extended and the sooner the better, particularly the Ombudsman' s powers of investigation laid down in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.
</seg>
<seg id=1238>
An Ombudsman is obviously limited by the rules governing secrecy documentary, but it is good that the citizens know that he or she, as Ombudsman, may have access to the documents that they themselves do not have.
</seg>
<seg id=1239>
The starting point of this report is the recommendation of the ombudsmann to the Commission, in relation to this, which make it possible for the candidates access to their examinations already corrected regarding the selection procedure organised by the same.
</seg>
<seg id=1240>
We believe that the Community institutions should carry out its procedures for recruitment, and indeed all its procedures, with maximum openness and transparency in order to avoid suspicions of partiality, injustice and administrative incompetence.
</seg>
<seg id=1241>
I am referring here to an amendment concerning the requirement to the test the development of the proof oral, for example.
</seg>
<seg id=1242>
Mr Bösch has already explained briefly here the amendments that have been made to this report.
</seg>
<seg id=1243>
Having paths put questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal opposition, received specific answers and detailed.
</seg>
<seg id=1244>
It begins to open the process of the government and to do so transparent.
</seg>
<seg id=1245>
Firstly, in the tests being made by the Commission, the corrections are always anonymously.
</seg>
<seg id=1246>
Obviously I was talking about July 2000.
</seg>
<seg id=1247>
VOTE
</seg>
<seg id=1248>
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
</seg>
<seg id=1249>
To assess the directive on own resources institutes credit must be carefully balanced the various interests that this conflict.
</seg>
<seg id=1250>
Then came the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and for the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1251>
This is the position defended by the rapporteur and that the European People' s Party shares.
</seg>
<seg id=1252>
The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is such that there is a great need for cooperation between the different police forces beyond the borders of their own country.
</seg>
<seg id=1253>
It seems that the majority of those who have spoken so far considers that it is essential that the College has a permanent headquarters.
</seg>
<seg id=1254>
The umpteenth interim decision but not precarious, a regalito that the Council tends to be done in this Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1255>
The rapporteur wishes to add the prevention of crime, the provision of services, innovation and border surveillance and also wants to change internal security in order to include the maintenance of law and order.
</seg>
<seg id=1256>
Those were the ideals we proposed and that was the kind of State by the working.
</seg>
<seg id=1257>
I welcome the possibility of levelling standards of some Member States of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1258>
Since the first thoughts on this dossier made at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission undertook to Member States to put forward an action intended to develop what we could consider a culture European police underpinned by the highest standards of ethics, respect for citizens' rights and freedoms and effectiveness in the fight against crime.
</seg>
<seg id=1259>
It claims that the Police College develops above all from a perspective intergovernmental.
</seg>
<seg id=1260>
For the reasons relating, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
</seg>
<seg id=1261>
- (SV) I have voted against the report on provisional establishment of the European Police College.
</seg>
<seg id=1262>
Certainly many of our courts are very slow and ponderosos, and it is very difficult to make act quickly in these matters.
</seg>
<seg id=1263>
Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since it connects with the regulation "Brussels II" , which does not include children whose parents are separated, as well as children extramatrimoniales.
</seg>
<seg id=1264>
My own mother was such a separation and kidnapping 85 years ago, and even talk about this.
</seg>
<seg id=1265>
Therefore, what I would like to say to Parliament that it is in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters - which we hope adoption by the end of this year, the Commission is proposing to grant first and top priority to the extension of the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, consequently, of this regulation on the right to visit, covering without discrimination to the children of married couples and the unions.
</seg>
<seg id=1266>
We shall now proceed to the vote.
</seg>
<seg id=1267>
Today, sport - and it has to be said, is closely linked to other economic sectors, such as the industries of the audiovisual sector or the promotion and sale of products sports.
</seg>
<seg id=1268>
What we need is a reasonable and flexible to interpret the current rules.
</seg>
<seg id=1269>
It is, strictly speaking, an attack on democracy, however much we avoid seeing things in this light.
</seg>
<seg id=1270>
That is why the Commission this waiting to receive an answer to your request detailed information on the measures planned by the UK Government.
</seg>
<seg id=1271>
This proposal was submitted by the Minister for the Economy in statement a a a six months before the presentation of the draft budget completely in the spring of 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=1272>
Again, I think that what was said by Mr Simpson has been of great help to reassure us on the probable intentions of the UK Government.
</seg>
<seg id=1273>
Jams are not just a waste of time, not only generate high costs, but for the environment are a problem, and therefore I believe, if the British Government allocated really money to solve these problems, then all receive something of this, especially all Europe' s citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=1274>
We are practically the only producer of oil from the European Union and yet we have the higher prices of petrol prices higher diesel compared with any other country in Europe - in Britain we are paying GBP 1.20 per litre of diesel.
</seg>
<seg id=1275>
This item is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=1276>
The European Parliament must tell them that is on your side, and I propose that, once again, to express a minute' s silence our solidarity and our emotions.
</seg>
<seg id=1277>
Madam President, I fully support it, since I am one of those who have asked for the inclusion of this point.
</seg>
<seg id=1278>
We some important steps forward.
</seg>
<seg id=1279>
The EU will deepen its relations with all the groups important and will also in contact with the new government of the United States as soon as possible.
</seg>
<seg id=1280>
Prescott on the agreement which he himself had produced, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet, but also - I believe - most of the other European environment ministers - and this is my last question to the Commissioner - rejected it?
</seg>
<seg id=1281>
It is to be feared that has been lost momentum and the American negotiators change and in may have to start again.
</seg>
<seg id=1282>
Forests have been this time the major obstacle.
</seg>
<seg id=1283>
Part of the soil of the countries of the European Union will become sea or desert as a result of continuous warming to which they are subjected.
</seg>
<seg id=1284>
The level of wealth is high and the price of oil products low.
</seg>
<seg id=1285>
I congratulate Commissioner Wallström for their efforts in The Hague and I wish you more successful.
</seg>
<seg id=1286>
No doubt it was better not to agree to have a bad agreement, and in this case the American position was a position of rebates, totally unacceptable for Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1287>
Climate change have major consequences in developing countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1288>
I would like to repeat it in English: forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.
</seg>
<seg id=1289>
Only this credibility will enable the European Union adopt the position and action in the COP VI "B" in Bonn.
</seg>
<seg id=1290>
We are going to have to do our own assessment of what happened and prepare documents to be in contact with the various parties and, of course, with the group representation of.
</seg>
<seg id=1291>
Of course, the follow-up to the next COP6 or the continuation of COP6 will be the ratification of an agreement within the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1292>
Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I myself will be the next Sunday a ministerial conclave to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a sitting of the IGC, on Monday, at the General Affairs Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1293>
The minimum number of Member States were to participate was to limit to, and the clause appeal to the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, being replaced by a right of knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1294>
We should regret it, but I am obliged to make this observation.
</seg>
<seg id=1295>
The European Council will also be discussing the progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1296>
The Lisbon European Council had approved guidelines to promote a European economy innovative and competitive.
</seg>
<seg id=1297>
Consumer protection is a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that do not require further explanation.
</seg>
<seg id=1298>
We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1299>
Unfortunately, the current text of the Conference is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long, with two protocols: however, despite this broad and this complication, is also very weak, has not made the simple answer is for the simple problem that we have a long time ago.
</seg>
<seg id=1300>
(Applause)
</seg>
<seg id=1301>
One was that the candidate Member States themselves should adopt and apply the "acquis communautaire" ; that is the task we share with us.
</seg>
<seg id=1302>
We appreciate very much the Charter of Fundamental rights and we do not want to confine ourselves to declamarla.
</seg>
<seg id=1303>
It is true that its wording could have been better, and it can be improved and pointed out after Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1304>
I find it unacceptable that several governments have refused outright to consider the possibility of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=1305>
You do not even want to introduce it in the Treaty and in evidence that this document, this exercise had to be set aside.
</seg>
<seg id=1306>
We will speak with a single thankless and vote in the WTO.
</seg>
<seg id=1307>
Given the dubious prospects of success, I do not think it is right bear the Intergovernmental Conference with another matter extremely complex and controversial.
</seg>
<seg id=1308>
I appeal urgently to the French Presidency in order to make every effort to remove this gap, since it is extremely destructive.
</seg>
<seg id=1309>
In terms of commercial policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be examined carefully.
</seg>
<seg id=1310>
But in the previous Treaty some progress was made in the implementation of this formula, also brought the absurd formula codecision more unanimity in matters relating to citizenship, social security, the rights of the self-employed and cultural policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1311>
The simple statement on this issue, is in itself clearly shows the failure of a policy of strengthening of ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1312>
This is the situation in which we have locked for months in this Intergovernmental Conference, and the reason is that nobody renunciation of its plaything.
</seg>
<seg id=1313>
This year' s experience compels us to say that the impetus should be given to the process of constitutionalisation of the Union after Nice and looking to the future of Europe must not be left to the method, already exhausted, reserved negotiation between the representatives of the governments.
</seg>
<seg id=1314>
As you just said Mr Prodi, if not adopting a rule on the majority decision-making is an obstacle to irremediably.
</seg>
<seg id=1315>
In our debate today nothing was said on that aspect of subsidiarity, but it is very important.
</seg>
<seg id=1316>
We did this happened, the 1995 enlargement, came the Reflection Group who chaired rightly great great big wine, Amsterdam and now we are going to have Nice and we almost like, Mr President: thinking about institutional matters, without finding solutions that will enable us to sell an ambitious task, which is that enlargement to 27.
</seg>
<seg id=1317>
Let us not add to the disappointment that will lead to the Nice Summit, if that Nice is, of course, it is futile, the disappointment caused to the peoples by our Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1318>
In the past, we are showing that this objective was achievable and, as a representative of a Member State that has benefited from a transition planned for accession, I hope with positive attitude the achievement of an enlarged Europe and peaceful.
</seg>
<seg id=1319>
But we must understand that if you are the right of veto, also have the others.
</seg>
<seg id=1320>
But we must also make a first transition for Parliament to be elected in 2004, because at least some Member States will join before the new Parliament elected in 2004 or during your term of office until 2009.
</seg>
<seg id=1321>
The President-in-Office of the Council has dealt with the issue of closer cooperation and said that we move towards a consensus in this regard.
</seg>
<seg id=1322>
Mr President, at first sight, Nice is the necessary adjustments and issues still unresolved for enlargement.
</seg>
<seg id=1323>
If we had something of this mentality, if we were to do less emphasis on what is going wrong in this part of the world and we put more emphasis on what is going well, it would be more fortunate than we are at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id=1324>
Majority decisions to be taken in the Council must not only apply to goods, but also other related areas such as services, investment, intellectual property and competition. Article 1 (133) has changed in that direction.
</seg>
<seg id=1325>
The European Parliament' s right of initiative would open the way for the arbitrariness of political parties invading ended this area also highly sensitive.
</seg>
<seg id=1326>
Therefore, as one of you said, by referring to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans talk about themselves, we should also stress what works and what is progressing.
</seg>
<seg id=1327>
I would also say that I do not believe that there is a problem between small and large countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1328>
We have worked hard, but we are facing this old problem, and I do not think we can start an evolution by the action of a single country, because we are facing, once again, in twelve of the fifteen Member situations - national policies, democratic - very important.
</seg>
<seg id=1329>
Lastly, Mr President, Mr Védrine you showed a situation too tense and also mentioned pessimism.
</seg>
<seg id=1330>
Will he take you, furthermore, measures in general to enhance safety forms of that cannot happen again something similar?
</seg>
<seg id=1331>
In my opinion, we must take precautions right - something that we have not yet done - to the guests of this Parliament can be pleased, without having to be frightened to potential threats. the objective is to create the necessary technical conditions, both from the point of view of the organisation as from the security point of view.
</seg>
<seg id=1332>
Here, hospitality; there, hospitality and respect.
</seg>
<seg id=1333>
Thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.
</seg>
<seg id=1334>
The best tribute to Lluch Ernest and his memory would be to respect their message - diàleg, in Catalan: can we offer the opportunity all the Basque people?
</seg>
<seg id=1335>
On the other hand, each can certainly express its opinion.
</seg>
<seg id=1336>
(B5-0550/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy, to the Commission, on the political situation in Afghanistan and humanitarian aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1337>
When I speak of organisation I should also like to say that, given the enormous efforts made by the European Union, it is logical that it is the responsibility of the same.
</seg>
<seg id=1338>
Secondly, you see in the resolution will very clear of Parliament to base the security and defence policy on two pillars: balanced civilian crisis management and, in the event of failure, military crisis management, since both are complementary pillars.
</seg>
<seg id=1339>
- (FR) Mr President, bearing in mind the delay and we also my duty, I will try to be brief the speech I had prepared.
</seg>
<seg id=1340>
These relations are plasmarán specifically in meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the COPSI and at meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidates or allies.
</seg>
<seg id=1341>
Consider, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where it can be said that each has played its full role.
</seg>
<seg id=1342>
In this period we have kept fully informed the United States progress under way under the European security and defence policy, which is a prerequisite for the same develops in harmony, as is the case at the moment.
</seg>
<seg id=1343>
In the European Parliament was the second edition of the European Union' s annual report on human rights. 13 December will be organised in Paris a forum dedicated to human rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1344>
This policy, you say no, ambition, compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which today remains the basis of the collective defence of its members, or create a European army permanent.
</seg>
<seg id=1345>
Furthermore, although I mentioned the figure of 100,000 60,000 troops, this does not mean that ambicionemos overcome the objective laid down in Helsinki, but that we have a reserve in qualifications and in different specialities, which makes it possible to ensure that could be achieved the men which correspond to the objective of the Council, beyond the operational conditions of their use.
</seg>
<seg id=1346>
Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, refer briefly to the political sense deep, approved by a large part of public opinion, and this new task, whereby Europe becomes a tool of political influence it was missing.
</seg>
<seg id=1347>
We are now facing the problem to ensure that, when we talk about consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe, we refer to the entire European continent, because this is enlargement and the enlargement process.
</seg>
<seg id=1348>
We must integrate three ramales into a coherent whole: Community policies, CFSP, including the ESDP, and national measures of the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1349>
Even with our cumbersome procedures of the Commission, we do not need a force of 60,000 soldiers to achieve our objectives.
</seg>
<seg id=1350>
We must therefore establish urgently a solution of humanitarian aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1351>
While it is true that I do not agree with the cynics who say that Europe achieves this with a new game impracticable, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be versatile in many situations.
</seg>
<seg id=1352>
The EU should not develop a defence system itself with regular troops.
</seg>
<seg id=1353>
Finally I would like to express my group' s concern at the worsening situation in Afghanistan and urge the Commission and the Council to do their utmost to achieve a peaceful solution and to help the population, especially now at the entrance to the winter.
</seg>
<seg id=1354>
To put it simply: where, when and how must act the European rapid reaction force.
</seg>
<seg id=1355>
May understand the terrible stock of these two months "intifada" : 270 10,000 dead, most Palestinians, and over injured, often baldados for life.
</seg>
<seg id=1356>
That is why his relentless efforts will serve to create an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction extremely bleak.
</seg>
<seg id=1357>
Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or desirable for the European Union to do more than what is before the conflict and the escalation of violence which has taken place in the Middle East, especially now, in the transitional period in which are the United States.
</seg>
<seg id=1358>
Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on dealing with Mrs Lalumière' s report, which, in my view, is well thought-out and expresses clearly.
</seg>
<seg id=1359>
There is a political concept and really does not yet exist a common foreign and security policy.
</seg>
<seg id=1360>
The EU has only one problem, namely that has so far not been able to awaken the interest of the public by such measures even though they are much more sustainable and effective.
</seg>
<seg id=1361>
Mr President, then there is, of course, the budget; how to share it.
</seg>
<seg id=1362>
And I say this, despite the huge amount of apparent that guarantees on this matter have arisen miraculously in recent days.
</seg>
<seg id=1363>
We should work together and in a coordinated fashion. we should move towards a better European policy on procurement in order to have a defence industry more efficient than offers greater value in return for the money.
</seg>
<seg id=1364>
Even those who question the usefulness of the decision, for example, to create called The the should the repair in the important political dimension of this decision and its influence in the cohesion of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1365>
It has been so historic first the presence of a defence minister in this House we have reserved the night sitting so that the impression is not too strong for our Members.
</seg>
<seg id=1366>
For all of them, a civil crisis management preventive is a better way than military solutions.
</seg>
<seg id=1367>
Do you wish to Russia, in the long term, to participate in a political union with an undemocratic regime?
</seg>
<seg id=1368>
Therefore, Europe will not be a new alliance, as I have heard mention in an argument informed so incomplete.
</seg>
<seg id=1369>
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to rule 5 (42) of the Rules of procedure, to wind up this debate.
</seg>
<seg id=1370>
Given the scale of the task, was given to four committees and established a procedure unprecedented, with four parallel reports.
</seg>
<seg id=1371>
All the measures proposed in the White Paper must agree to modernise and make effective all the functioning of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1372>
Therefore, it would be appropriate for the reform outside the opportunity to restrict his speech only in areas that do not involve expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=1373>
The differences of opinion that arose were not only of a political nature, but even more reflected the cultural differences between the Fifteen.
</seg>
<seg id=1374>
The new internal audit service, under the direct responsibility of you, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform will be main task the analysis of the functions and systems of internal control that exist within the Commission.

It has been a pleasure to work together and I believe that the process to address a crucial reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union, has had a depth and wealth added thanks to the participation of us four.
</seg>
<seg id=1376>
May have expectations of relocation to other European institutions, implementation of committees of services in the national administrations or work in the private sector.
</seg>
<seg id=1377>
In this way, our constitutional committee recalls its attachment to a Commission strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.
</seg>
<seg id=1378>
As the Committee on Budgets consider that the introduction of activity-based budgeting causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.
</seg>
<seg id=1379>
This will mark, of course, the goodwill of this Parliament to pursue this reform with the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1380>
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.
</seg>
<seg id=1381>
This is shameful if we take into account that the EU itself is the first supporter of the modernisation of economic life.
</seg>
<seg id=1382>
Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, is that the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts is not yet a global and coherent response with a view to a policy of government and not only to better management of the institution.
</seg>
<seg id=1383>
This change of attitude should result in the transparency of the administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1384>
In my view, in the world is not a structure that magazine greater significance and fundamental: fifteen Member States and in the future twenty or more, an entire continent; the part of the globe currently most industrialised late in the Union and, through it, in the Commission through its structures.
</seg>
<seg id=1385>
The change is never easy.
</seg>
<seg id=1386>
In doing so, however, from the Socialist Group believe that the current functioning of the European public service is quite effective.
</seg>
<seg id=1387>
The result is well known, has indicated that the commitment and the competence of the many members of the Commission and its administration.
</seg>
<seg id=1388>
Many thousands of requests for projects are already more than a year waiting for an evaluation.
</seg>
<seg id=1389>
The debate, as we have seen, is not so much of principles, objectives or opportunity of reform, the procedures, pace, timetable, possible malfunctions or unintended consequences of its application.
</seg>
<seg id=1390>
I should like to begin by informing the House that at its meeting this morning, as has been pointed out before Mr van Hulten, the College has adopted a draft interinstitutional agreement for the establishment of an advisory group on basic standards in public life, as provided for in action 1 of the action programme of the White Paper.
</seg>
<seg id=1391>
Furthermore, these changes, it is clear that would only be possible with a modification of the Treaties.
</seg>
<seg id=1392>
The main aim is to achieve a simplification, increase the transparency and strengthen the budgetary principles, that is, in particular less derogations, less special arrangements incomprehensible and increase the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure.
</seg>
<seg id=1393>
It is simply very uneconomic for the Commission to according to contracts for costs X has to be reimburse 20% for costs and 30%, and it is often together and check the evidence of sums very small.
</seg>
<seg id=1394>
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and cooperation, on the effectiveness of the European Union' s relations with the developing countries and the impact of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000/2051(INI)).
</seg>
<seg id=1395>
The latter relate in particular to the NGOs.
</seg>
<seg id=1396>
Of course, that is not enough, but with everything must be protected from the cartoons on the shortage of our development aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1397>
Once again this now because it is a good framework in itself.
</seg>
<seg id=1398>
Mr President, I returned today Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for a brilliant humanitarian aid following the disaster of the floods, but, once again, the reconstruction projects, to which we have already allocated money, are behind pending signatures in Brussels.
</seg>
<seg id=1399>
Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is inevitable.
</seg>
<seg id=1400>
We now have a harmonised approach to produce country strategy papers and programmes cooperation of all the developing countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1401>
In addition, the creation of the SEM failed to provide a solution to the continuing disparity between 8 bulky administrative resources.
</seg>
<seg id=1402>
- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the reason I had a very strong interest for being here with you today in this debate on the first package sea in the European Parliament, is that you are going to consider three important texts, which are an essential first step on a topic that recent events have placed, unfortunately, the front page of today.
</seg>
<seg id=1403>
From the point of view of the presidency of the Council, this could afford, moreover, to discuss with the Member States an agreement on the basis of the proposals put forward by you, and adopt the text at first reading, with qualified majority if necessary.
</seg>
<seg id=1404>
The rapid treatment and specialised who had result in the two Erika packages and six proposals has generated an enormous boost.
</seg>
<seg id=1405>
The lesson that Parliament must retain this morning is that undoubtedly maritime law is throughout the world in a state of vagueness and we have to start the process of put in order.
</seg>
<seg id=1406>
We must give a clear signal that in water and European ports we will not tolerate vessels which do not meet the standards.
</seg>
<seg id=1407>
For the smaller ships, we adopted a position of compromise between the limit of 5,000 tonnes, raised by the IMO, and that of the 600 proposed by the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1408>
These data should be made available to the European authorities, state and port, as well as the public interest.
</seg>
<seg id=1409>
The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, designed to the need for a framework of Community cooperation in the field of accidental contamination.
</seg>
<seg id=1410>
In the cooperation at local level have been included organisations for the protection of nature.
</seg>
<seg id=1411>
Amending the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, harmonisation of the laws, particularly as regards the selection of vessels subject to inspection and the scope of the different types of inspection, is clearly positive.
</seg>
<seg id=1412>
I should like to point out once again that there is no urgency, where you persist.
</seg>
<seg id=1413>
I believe that in the case of the limit liability of classification societies, irrespective of what is decided today, it is essential that the Council and Parliament will reflect together on this.
</seg>
<seg id=1414>
The black box, a black list and everything else we believe to be excellent ideas and we fully agree with them, but I would like to stress a few points.
</seg>
<seg id=1415>
Faced with this catastrophic situation and anarchic of maritime transport, Europe has accepted the challenge and eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be in a position to announce that never any procedure has worked so quickly.
</seg>
<seg id=1416>
It is clear to what extent the liberal logic is opposed to a high degree of safety at sea.
</seg>
<seg id=1417>
Finally, regardless of the technical measures to be taken, one of the largest sources of uncertainty will continue to exist in not both both, both in the area of the channel and the North Atlantic, the exponential growth traffic arising from excessive pandering to the North Sea ports.
</seg>
<seg id=1418>
I would be to our credit to the current President-in-Office of the Council have the situation in their own country.
</seg>
<seg id=1419>
Mr President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika have been tabled under political pressure a series of measures in order to increase the safety of ships at sea.
</seg>
<seg id=1420>
Greek ships collapsed without further, Mr Gayssot, without storms.
</seg>
<seg id=1421>
Thirdly, when we talk about reports of this kind, it seems to me that it is becoming clear that are not linking the relationship between, on the one hand, the supply of oil and, on the other hand, the fact that it is still use fossil fuel.
</seg>
<seg id=1422>
Therefore, we finally have the political courage to our environmental ambitions.
</seg>
<seg id=1423>
This means that, in this field more than in any other, our responsibility is huge, and that we must, in my view, silence any sign of self-respect institutional.
</seg>
<seg id=1424>
For example, in Finland is of the utmost importance that Russia sign these agreements.
</seg>
<seg id=1425>
It is a question of tightening up the requirements for the construction of vessels oil tankers, of improving the rules for port controls and greater severity rules for organisations of inspection and peritaje of vessels, which is a consequence of this.
</seg>
<seg id=1426>
Mr President, today we are debating maritime safety based on three reports whose rapporteurs sincerely congratulate her.
</seg>
<seg id=1427>
With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have shown deadlines in in that Parliament is very determined to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, controls, the construction standards and that it is intolerable that similar accidents happen again.
</seg>
<seg id=1428>
Madam President, in the recent past several marine accidents considerable consequences, especially those in the who were involved oil tankers, have shaken our continent.
</seg>
<seg id=1429>
More than 80% of accidents are connected with human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social order.
</seg>
<seg id=1430>
A parliamentary or parliamentary has used the term "traceability" .
</seg>
<seg id=1431>
The directive state control of the port is designed to monitor compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules.
</seg>
<seg id=1432>
Amendment No 18 introduces state control of the port because in relation to rest periods of seafarers, although the application of the provisions relating to the working hours of seafarers is already fully covered by Directive 99/95.
</seg>
<seg id=1433>
I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced in amendment No 21 a reference to the system of evaluation of the conditions and we agree with the proposal perspective, however it is necessary that meets the wording for clarification.
</seg>
<seg id=1434>
Amendment No 4 and part of No 18 on the item K are not acceptable.
</seg>
<seg id=1435>
I can assure you that if a shipowner intends to include a ship in the register, following our proposal must pensárselo twice.
</seg>
<seg id=1436>
The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes, and in the meantime, mentioned dozens and dozens of articles, and rejected the Commission' s position.
</seg>
<seg id=1437>
Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a range of actions relating to the trans-European network, collection of creating and disseminating statistics on the challenges of goods intra-European and extra-comunitarios (EDICOM) (COM(00)0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201(COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)
</seg>
<seg id=1438>
However, by withdrawing the resolution, I am convinced that, with a view to the Nice Council, Parliament would have done better to hear your voice devoting a specific resolution and different issues as important and difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of treating them in the context of a single resolution which includes all the other items on the agenda of the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1439>
(Since there have been more than twelve Members, the oral amendment was rejected) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
</seg>
<seg id=1440>
Report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries, and the impact of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000/2051(INI))
</seg>
<seg id=1441>
I voted against to register my protest at the fact that the European Union fails still intervene and should also in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1442>
Despite that neither the amendment of the existing directive on control of vessels or the Watts report correspond to the real needs, give certain steps in a positive sense, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.
</seg>
<seg id=1443>
We regret that the Commission' s proposal has not taken up the idea of the creation of a genuine monitoring body of along the lines of the "coast guards" in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id=1444>
- (EL) precondition for the safety of ships, for the protection of life at sea and environmental protection is the fight against the immunity enjoyed by the shipowners, the adoption of strict measures for the control of the situation of vessels and imposing strict penalties to shipping companies which violate safety standards; similarly, improving working conditions of workers in the Merchant Navy, and providing proper training, as well as ensuring organic constructions which respond to the growing needs of ships.
</seg>
<seg id=1445>
The rapporteur Hatzidakis, unfortunately, has done the opposite.
</seg>
<seg id=1446>
The sinking of the Erika, in December 1999, is at the root of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the agenda Community policy and was under pressure from the European Parliament as the Commission proposed the texts we have today voted, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.
</seg>
<seg id=1447>
The current compensation funds have not been adequately equipped and this has become more obvious in the case of the Braer disaster, in which the fishing industry of the Shetland Islands has not been properly compensated for their losses.
</seg>
<seg id=1448>
Madam President, I have already said that a few years ago I had the opportunity to navigate.
</seg>
<seg id=1449>
The rapporteur' s proposals concerning the harmonisation at European level are entirely positive.
</seg>
<seg id=1450>
This is an important paragraph as it concerns the classification societies of ships.
</seg>
<seg id=1451>
It would be rather a great success, since the Europe that we need, on the eve of enlargement, it is not a rigid Europe, jerarquizada, remote, but a flexible Europe and closer to the people, therefore based on respect for national democracies.
</seg>
<seg id=1452>
The fight increasingly open for power between many Member States muddies the possibility of reaching a compromise.
</seg>
<seg id=1453>
The most important task of Nice is to ensure that the EU has efficient institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=1454>
One week after the summit, I personally hope.
</seg>
<seg id=1455>
Nor am I in favour of linking automatically qualified majority voting and codecision and also believe that any initiative to extend the powers of codecision must be undertaken on a case-by-case basis.
</seg>
<seg id=1456>
When amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting, which is currently in force in the Council for the trade in goods, to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.
</seg>
<seg id=1457>
In this way Parliament independent of the right of influence, keeps quiet as tribute to the partidismos, the fidelidades and national governments and forgets its obligations towards the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=1458>
I have also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Treaty is adopted in Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1459>
It is a mistake to divide the Union into two groups, and that is why I cannot support the idea that a third of the Member States is at the helm.
</seg>
<seg id=1460>
Your new role has put an end to the neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.

<seg id=1461>
In this report there are many things that the group of the Consevadores British can support, in particular the emphasis placed on the enlargement of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1462>
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have supported the report on the creation of a common European policy in the field of security and defence.
</seg>
<seg id=1463>
But also against the peoples of the European Union will have to finance, in any case, the new armament spending proposed in the report and which does not even have the guarantee that the military forces are not used a day against themselves, in the name of "policing" .
</seg>
<seg id=1464>
Just as serious is the pretence that a state which does not wish to take part in a mission will be obliged to pay a financial contribution repartirán states participating in that war.
</seg>
<seg id=1465>
However, with military means outside is not achieved any solution, because it does not remove the causes of the conflict or change public opinion.
</seg>
<seg id=1466>
· that military operations should be financed with a budget line Community and Member States having to contribute funds even if it does not wish to take part in operations (Paragraphs 49 and 50).
</seg>
<seg id=1467>
Instead, the EU would suit that it would invest the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and address the attention towards options humanitarian and civilians.
</seg>
<seg id=1468>
I support this report by my colleague Maj-Britt Theorin.
</seg>
<seg id=1469>
But there is no mention the needs of this category to give way to the demand for a tax deducibilidad services household and of a "adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities of individuals" .
</seg>
<seg id=1470>
In fact, it is extraordinary that in the 21st century we have to recommend that Member States should guarantee for employees domestic the right to social security and a proper retirement.
</seg>
<seg id=1471>
For many young people, its first contact with the labour market can be a undeclared work.
</seg>
<seg id=1472>
What is more serious is above when it comes to women from distant countries, who took this type of work by necessity and which have no other means of earning a living in a sustainable manner.
</seg>
<seg id=1473>
The reform of the Commission will be judged by the facts, hence the need for monitoring reports regular presented during the entire period of duration of the programme and the importance of full account waited for December 2002.
</seg>
<seg id=1474>
In the recent past, various scandals and failures concluded in March 1999, with the resignation of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1475>
In conclusion, I consider it essential to remember that through this reform, which is essential for the future, we look at the same time more rigorous and more transparency on the part of the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, within the strict framework of its powers.
</seg>
<seg id=1476>
Conservatives we also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report by which it should guarantee democratic control and allowing operating the system of the three pillars.
</seg>
<seg id=1477>
(The sitting was closed at 13.15 p.m.)
</seg>

We have received information - and I would like to add immediately not that that that at all - that the President-in-Office of the Council and French Head of State is going to appear here tomorrow only 30 minutes to speak.
</seg>
<seg id=1479>
It therefore seems to me that we should exclude that we can have a well-considered position and argued.
</seg>
<seg id=1480>
Whatever we do, we vote, and I am in favour of a resolution as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1481>
During the night work has been done in both these texts and in the figures relating to the distribution of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1482>
Madam President, I would urge that there be removed from the agenda the report by Mr de Roo, since, in addition to be extremely well prepared, in the last Council of Environment of the French Presidency, which will take place on Monday and Tuesday of next week, it is planned to prepare a common position on this matter.
</seg>
<seg id=1483>
Thank you, Mr Parish.

The political basis is clear: harmonising the market respecting a high level of public health and consumer protection on the basis both in the existing regulations as well as the development of scientific knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id=1486>
What is at stake their quality and concept of life, where the protection of health is a very relevant weight.

<seg id=1487>
This rule can also be applied to all drugs fun but dangerous, if no one else that the consumer can be affected.

Recently in the United States they have earned trials against the tobacco multinationals for poison and lying on the absence of toxicity of products.

We believe that the only possible and consistent is to put an end to the export of cigarettes are prohibited in the EU for health reasons.

<seg id=1490>
Instead of drawing lessons from the failure recorded in Luxembourg on 9 October last, we insist on an attitude legally indefensible.
</seg>
<seg id=1491>
I have carefully analysed what the Commissioner said to my colleague Mr Hume: there can be no massive loss of jobs in this sector.
</seg>
<seg id=1492>
Parliament and the Council are those who have to approve this proposal for a directive and examine, among other things, the appropriate legal basis for this.
</seg>
<seg id=1493>
Maaten and others - there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation which propose the leader of the European People' s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying our hands to the legislative development of the Community institutions, so that it is important for the development of Community law.
</seg>
<seg id=1494>
The weak point of this proposal is that stressed the promotion of free competition.
</seg>
<seg id=1495>
In conclusion, since the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has powers of coordination in environmental issues and consumer protection, and collaborate closely, of course, with the Council and the Commission in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1496>
In fact this has nothing to do with tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of Justice could have been dictated also to ban the advertising of alcohol or advertising chocolate because, of course, sugar can also be harmful to health.
</seg>
<seg id=1497>
I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wishes to propose to relax the rules relating to export more than propose their own governments of the Member States - Governments also representing the many industries that refers.
</seg>
<seg id=1498>
It is an established fact that 80% of smokers want to be, but in the tobacco sector encourages very few policies to help these people to stop smoking.
</seg>
<seg id=1499>
If we insist on to tell other countries what levels of public health should set by extending export our reasonable proposals for the internal market threatens all the good work done by Mr Maaten.
</seg>
<seg id=1500>
We want to reach a method of evidence recognised in all countries of the EU, to be carried out in a given country in a laboratory testing recognised.
</seg>
<seg id=1501>
Today is openly acknowledge the effects on health of tobacco consumption, and both legislators as public opinion share the feeling that the time has come to adopt rules and strict regulations in this area.
</seg>
<seg id=1502>
Consequently, rules The the perfectly in the future international agreements, thus avoiding the risk of barriers to trade and at the same time strengthening the protection of consumers and guaranteeing a high level of health protection.
</seg>
<seg id=1503>
It would be preferable to wait until we have dealt with the issue of additives as a whole in the first report of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1504>
As regards laboratory tests, the amendment relating to the adoption of evidence is superfluous, since other article already provides for the movement of goods which comply with the provisions of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1505>
Madam President, this report is not complications: at present, the directives on the summertime are only five years in force, and then have to come back to Parliament for its renewal.
</seg>
<seg id=1506>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the provisions on summer-time, that there are discussed, is a good proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1507>
I therefore believe that in this House should not take too long on this subject, because the Member States, as well as the population, have already accepted largely regulation of summer time and it has been recognised as part of our annual rate.
</seg>
<seg id=1508>
In my opinion, it is appropriate that issues relating to slots and with the implementation of the provisions of the summer time left, in accordance with the proposal in the area of decision making in the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1509>
It would be more justified that summer-time terminase at the end of September, some six months of its beginning.
</seg>
<seg id=1510>
It can accept submitting appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report 2007 referred to in Article 5.
</seg>
<seg id=1511>
It is clear that cannot be accepted human germ line intervention.
</seg>
<seg id=1512>
Indeed, I believe that an ethics committee in the working people who does this work as main profession, he can grant a slightly longer term, but on the authorities should exert pressure of time for rapidly to work.
</seg>
<seg id=1513>
These groups should remain within the scope of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1514>
But I am also pleased that we have managed to take a cerrojazo to therapy.
</seg>
<seg id=1515>
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to reconcile the contrary positions.
</seg>
<seg id=1516>
These programmes are linked to the fight against cancer, with the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and promoting health; and the adjournment would mean an end to the projects and the work of the networks that were created for this purpose.
</seg>
<seg id=1517>
It is a very good thing to prepare the ground a priori, so that, even in the event that it is necessary to make a second reading, be very close to the point at which decisions are taken.
</seg>
<seg id=1518>
Furthermore, we must bear in mind that both prevention and promotion and monitoring are becoming increasingly important and therefore we should give them more budgets and give them more important.
</seg>
<seg id=1519>
Madam President, during the Trakatellis report on the extension of European programmes that exist in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about how and in what way is evolving European policy in the field of public health.
</seg>
<seg id=1520>
I understand that the Council has also given in principle their consent.
</seg>
<seg id=1521>
In the European Union is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must live with the maintenance of 15 borders in the fields of police and judicial criminal, that Member States are in difficulties eliminated.
</seg>
<seg id=1522>
To conclude, the initiative represents a major step forward in the creation of a judicial area European criminal, albeit partial and limited, but responds to the real needs of a huge volume of European citizens that, so far, state have have when they have been victims of crime outside the territory of their habitual residence.
</seg>
<seg id=1523>
What we have asked for this group of people?
</seg>
<seg id=1524>
At the same time, we must ensure a special training professionals who will have to office direct contact with the victims.
</seg>
<seg id=1525>
The victims must not become people doubly penalised, firstly because of a crime and then through the system.
</seg>
<seg id=1526>
Also, in this regard it is important that they should be so a a a professional relatives, i.e. to the victims' families, the facts if they so wish, and that they can count on the support needed so that we do not have to know all through the press.
</seg>
<seg id=1527>
This applies irrespective of crime which was committed.
</seg>
<seg id=1528>
Never, at Member State level or in the Community, we need to abandon the basic principle that individuals must always take responsibility for their actions.
</seg>
<seg id=1529>
In other cases could be obtained information that is required in a language of the Union which is not itself.
</seg>
<seg id=1530>
I welcome the positive response by our Parliament before the first text on such an important issue, so that the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building progressively can offer our citizens support in situations that often find it hard to bear.
</seg>
<seg id=1531>
Vote on request for urgent procedure
</seg>
<seg id=1532>
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
</seg>
<seg id=1533>
In this way, during the night of 23 to 24 November we agreed with the Council on the main points of a budget that although it is not brilliant is reasonable.
</seg>
<seg id=1534>
That is why the Commission proposed a revision by EUR 300 million to what was opposed tooth and nail the Council.
</seg>
<seg id=1535>
But I also know by the discussions that is even more difficult to formulate a Council position negotiable, to obtain a mandate and ensure that the pure national self-interests lead to a decision pan-European more or less reasonable and defensible.
</seg>
<seg id=1536>
I hope that the work on a recruitment office common, as stated in the modern German, i.e. an authority recruitment of really move forward so that we can overcome together the problems that will be put in the coming years to all the institutions - the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions, namely the need to staff in the coming years.
</seg>
<seg id=1537>
The Council refuses to do this review - it seems that now we should have data - and I would like to prevent: to use the flexibility instrument two years in a row, two consecutive years - indeed, in less than 600 months and the first to less than six months of the adoption of the prospects - is vaciando financially the flexibility instrument because prevents replenishment and its possible accumulation, which is scheduled to a height of million.
</seg>
<seg id=1538>
This amount so important, which responds to the existence of needs very high in 2001, will be financed mainly thanks to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument amounting to EUR 200 million.
</seg>
<seg id=1539>
Bearing in mind this new element, the Council has voted at second reading a budget increased by 2.5%.
</seg>
<seg id=1540>
Finally, before you proceed to the final adoption of this budget, I would like to emphasize the efforts of the Council in respect certain rules basic budget, in terms of putting into reserve appropriations, legal basis and classification of expenditure.
</seg>
<seg id=1541>
And in contrast to Nice, I believe that the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are very satisfied in general, with the result.
</seg>
<seg id=1542>
Ladies and gentlemen, the emergence of new sick cows of BSE was also necessary to act immediately in the budgetary sector, in particular for the protection of health, consumer protection and also for aid to farmers affected by this situation.
</seg>
<seg id=1543>
In addition, the Council has set for the framework programme for reconstruction aid in the Western Balkans a multiannual amount, clearly indicative, which is compatible with this financial perspective.
</seg>
<seg id=1544>
With a great deal of effort, we obtained a couple of million.
</seg>
<seg id=1545>
I should like to thank Mrs Haug.
</seg>
<seg id=1546>
Then think that 1% of the budget of the European Union is very well spent.
</seg>
<seg id=1547>
You said, if I have understood you correctly, that we must not use the reserve, because it was a contravention of the rules.
</seg>
<seg id=1548>
I believe that we have seen very positive things along with many others I shall not mention now because of the limited time.
</seg>
<seg id=1549>
Despite that expenditure on agriculture, which represent almost half of the total budget, are increasing, once taken account of the letter of amendment, in more than 5%, the total increase of the budget is only 3.5%.
</seg>
<seg id=1550>
We see the great danger that in the coming years will increase the confrontation between MEDA projects of countries bordering the Mediterranean and the Balkans in spite of the fact that we all know that is needed there urgently money.
</seg>
<seg id=1551>
Satisfied at having overcome the difficulties that did so closely the path towards the objective of honouring their commitments in Helsinki with the candidate countries without undo the Union, to allow the Europe of tomorrow that it continues to operate effectively.
</seg>
<seg id=1552>
Are real, but not go as far as the presidency - which has shown, and I stress, at national level, a great openness - I would have wished.
</seg>
<seg id=1553>
Provision has been made for a legal basis new to the statute for European political parties and Parliament being granted the status of institutional plaintiff laid down in Article 230 of the Treaty.
</seg>
<seg id=1554>
Recent weeks have been achieved three important achievements.
</seg>
<seg id=1555>
This is the purpose of the declaration adopted at Nice and the deliberations to coordinate at European level the fight against doping.
</seg>
<seg id=1556>
Between the threats, is, as you all know, the overheating climate.
</seg>
<seg id=1557>
Furthermore, in Nice, the European Union has established the permanent bodies necessary to define and conduct a common foreign and security policy: a Political and Security Committee, a military committee and a state more Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1558>
For this cooperation, for their support and also for your welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency them thanks.
</seg>
<seg id=1559>
In these areas, in fact, the conference has failed due to the intransigence of certain Member States. in this respect, I feel deep disappointment not only for the short-term consequences, but by the spirit of deadlock, closure, incomprehension that emerges from this position.
</seg>
<seg id=1560>
We must pay heartfelt tribute to the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt appreciates that has been fought to the bottom in the name of a presence fairer of the candidate countries and to make less unreasonable, although it is still too high, the threshold of the qualified majority, so that has confirmed the great historic role in Belgium in the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1561>
We now have to carefully examine the text in Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1562>
I would point out, in passing, Mr President-in-Office, that expenditure the taxpayers' .
</seg>
<seg id=1563>
And I see it as a failure not only in relation to the proclaimed ambition of the European Union to change the institutions to be able to welcome correctly to the new Member States improving the effectiveness of the European Union, but also a failure in connection with another important objective, which perhaps has been mentioned very little, bringing the European Union and the citizens.
</seg>
<seg id=1564>
The questions are good for us the who asked the impressive human tide that, from the whole of Europe, has convergido in Nice on the eve of the summit.
</seg>
<seg id=1565>
Firstly, the Fifteen have signed hastily and teargas the Charter of fundamental rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1566>
(Applause)
</seg>
<seg id=1567>
My Group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we can all take, so we shall oppose it with all our strength.
</seg>
<seg id=1568>
Mr President, you have the floor.
</seg>
<seg id=1569>
Finally, I would say to Mr Hager that the instrument of closer cooperation is, in my opinion, a useful tool to enable Europe to have a dynamic and deliver the way, as I said just now, I believe, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1570>
Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament on summer-time is a new conquest of Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1571>
We demoralised until now because of the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories perhaps find, in the desire expressed both by the Member States and by this House, the value of developing the market of medicinal products for paediatric use, although it does not have the size enough to allow the recovery of investment.
</seg>
<seg id=1572>
Is it necessary. dealing with the change of summer time, which was established during the oil crisis, in order to save energy, and that was extended until 2001?
</seg>
<seg id=1573>
Not always the protection of the situation of victims in criminal proceedings is due.
</seg>
<seg id=1574>
As a result, many passengers and tourists will benefit from this European initiative.
</seg>
<seg id=1575>
Mr President, I would like to speak only to greet Mr President of the Commission, who is here, and the Presidency of the Council that is looming, and to stress that probably never has been expressed in this Parliament unanimity like this on the results of a summit.
</seg>
<seg id=1576>
Which works is that, in six months, under the leadership of the French Presidency, has ended, I believe, in spite of everything, your work on six key chapters.
</seg>
<seg id=1577>
However, my greatest fear is that Britain, France and Germany can now subvert the delicate balance created between states of different sizes and between the institutions over several decades.
</seg>
<seg id=1578>
It is difficult to understand how the Nice decisions could facilitate the enlargement of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=1579>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today I can be very brief.
</seg>
<seg id=1580>
For all these reasons, I can only draw the result that when we vote on the Treaty of Nice, I shall say no.
</seg>
<seg id=1581>
Mr President, the most important result of Nice was, in spite of everything, which was signed a treaty, so that it is now possible to space to the candidate countries.
</seg>
<seg id=1582>
The real winners of this conference are Blair and Aznar, Messrs "no" in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1583>
Then, forget Nice, look at what comes after, and let me that you sparking off my hope with the draft convention great progress by Belgium for your Presidency, because it is demonstrated that there is a clean sheet, we need to change of method, must be accelerated history: 2004 is too late, is far too, it is too dangerous.
</seg>
<seg id=1584>
Instead, the spirit of Nice has been to ask ourselves how we can block, how we can intergubernamentalizar, how can I praise one at home as a defender of national interests instead of working for the European Union really progress.
</seg>
<seg id=1585>
After Amsterdam and Nice we are a Europe of principados, a Europe of national administrations and not the Europe of political union.
</seg>
<seg id=1586>
We cannot continue to tackle the lack of decision-making by qualified majority on the essential issues.
</seg>
<seg id=1587>
It is true - parafrasearé Mr Bayrou - I am that this seat since this morning; at the beginning, accompanying the President of the Republic, and later, in a personal capacity, and llueven criticisms, which, in my view, are moderate, friendly, but which, however, have yet to be criticism.
</seg>
<seg id=1588>
In fact, we must not forget that this is the first time since 1957 that is reformed, revising the model.
</seg>
<seg id=1589>
We are in systems of the powers and cannot be confused.
</seg>
<seg id=1590>
Thank you very much, Minister.
</seg>
<seg id=1591>
But nor has been incorporated into the Treaties and there has been a reference to the Charter in Article 2 (6) of the Treaty on European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1592>
Finally, there are some positive aspects: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and their status; the right of this Parliament to make to the other institutions before the Court of Justice: this is also an important factor of political control; the new formula for the European Commission, to include the so-called "lex Prodi" in the Treaty, to strengthen the President and the new composition of the Commission: reasonable compromise that I accept and will work with the time; and, as pointed out by my colleague Mr Tsatsos, is the way forward in the future.
</seg>
<seg id=1593>
Mr President, we have already made a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but it should be remembered that the Nice Summit began with an agenda very limited.
</seg>
<seg id=1594>
Let us look at things: has not been included in the work of the Treaty the Charter, not even a comment.
</seg>
<seg id=1595>
We want to demonstrate to the Heads of Government that we know do better.
</seg>
<seg id=1596>
Despite the blows of chest that the French Government has given this morning, the IGC frankly not, either.
</seg>
<seg id=1597>
Mr President, it is not easy to criticise the French presidency during this debate, because it is not present. understand that President Chirac, Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1598>
Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference has been outdated.
</seg>
<seg id=1599>
2001 budget (Continuation)
</seg>
<seg id=1600>
However, this does not mean that we could not have done something more and better. I would divide the two areas.
</seg>
<seg id=1601>
This maxim obliges the Commission to set priorities within a limited budget, as must make any authority.
</seg>
<seg id=1602>
With the vote following this debate ends the long and complex process of adoption of the budget of the European Union for 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=1603>
That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis resorting to Article 272; there have been the Financial Perspective, despite having used the flexibility instrument.
</seg>
<seg id=1604>
Let me just say to the Council that, with regard to this party, we have not been footballs without this team and intends to continue playing until we get the appropriate outcome.
</seg>
<seg id=1605>
We do not want in the resolution Colom is already a revised proposal for next year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share your criticism that this way of resolving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual character of the major external objectives of the Union and the actual definition of the financial perspective.
</seg>
<seg id=1606>
In order to do this, we must set priorities.
</seg>
<seg id=1607>
Only then will be devoted correct and properly the money that our fellow citizens are at our disposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1608>
If we estimate the supplementary budget expected then it will be almost 8% while in all the other areas - whether the training policy, internal policy, including research, foreign policy, administration, pre-accession aid to experience - in total only a growth rate of 1.1%.
</seg>
<seg id=1609>
And as cooperation is very positive, in the next supplementary budget, back in January, we will have the opportunity to proseguirla.
</seg>
<seg id=1610>
We also also also relations not yet regulated between Russia and the Baltic States.
</seg>
<seg id=1611>
We are following with great interest the developments in society and politics internal Russian.
</seg>
<seg id=1612>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy towards Russia represents the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1613>
Even if President Putin assure us democratic development in his country, he is not automatically a guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia. the democratic order is not yet a reality experienced in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id=1614>
We should not be insidiosos on our part, but that we must build the Europe of economic cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=1615>
With regard to the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is absolutely right.
</seg>
<seg id=1616>
Anyone looking to Russia from outside and receive isolated impressions of the country and Russian partners is in danger of declare selectively this as the reality of the country which fits in their image of Russia.
</seg>
<seg id=1617>
In the political field, the common strategy towards Russia intend to enter a permanent dialogue on political and security and to create a permanent mechanism.
</seg>
<seg id=1618>
I would like to stress the seriousness that Russia is a political union with Belarus.
</seg>
<seg id=1619>
Do you intend to support this project, Commissioner Patten?
</seg>
<seg id=1620>
In this respect, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi, as Parliament will know, launched a wide-ranging dialogue on energy.
</seg>
<seg id=1621>
I very much hope to visit Kaliningrad personally in the first part of next year and not just because Immanuel Kant happened throughout their lives in that city.
</seg>
<seg id=1622>
I congratulate the honourable Member once again on his excellent report on a very important issue, which in the coming years we will refer again and again, I am sure, in this Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1623>
You puts me in a very difficult position.
</seg>
<seg id=1624>
Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very necessary since the BSE crisis has an enormous impact on feedingstuffs, on the cultivation and import of feedingstuffs.
</seg>
<seg id=1625>
The Council has expressed its concern in many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular to make it think again to make excessive use of force and avoid a possible extension of the conflict, to proceed independent inquiries and to the violations of human rights, to support the group of the OSCE assistance in carrying out its duty and, finally, to ensure that the transport of humanitarian aid.
</seg>
<seg id=1626>
Mr President, on a point of order, it is customary in this House that the questions that cannot be respond orally way of respond later in writing.
</seg>
<seg id=1627>
(Interruption from Mr Posselt)
</seg>
<seg id=1628>
This directive is 1992.
</seg>
<seg id=1629>
In this respect we must work.
</seg>
<seg id=1630>
These groups are obviously left on the sidelines of this new proposal.
</seg>
<seg id=1631>
- (FR) the Presidency and several Member States have already received correspondence committee of the European sugar manufacturers concerning the Commission' s proposal, which will be taken into account in its deliberations.
</seg>
<seg id=1632>
Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):
</seg>
<seg id=1633>
Firstly, I must say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council has not responded still to the question by Mr Korakas.
</seg>
<seg id=1634>
We now need to establish the authority and I believe that the authorities are European European European and that we must go ahead.
</seg>
<seg id=1635>
More specifically, has met the representative of the presidency, in this case the French ambassador in Algeria, with Mr.
</seg>
<seg id=1636>
We welcome the provisions proposed in this regard by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly regarding the way accreditation of non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001.
</seg>
<seg id=1637>
Cooperation contains a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights.
</seg>
<seg id=1638>
As underlined the Council to the honourable Member in her earlier answer, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will best protect the rights of the people.
</seg>
<seg id=1639>
I would like to push him a little more.
</seg>
<seg id=1640>
In particular, guarantees the political control and strategic direction a military operation of crisis management.
</seg>
<seg id=1641>
I should simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty establishing a difference in treatment between the taxes and excise duties, in which harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - Article 93 - and the approximation, provided for in Article 94, of the legislation that impact directly on the establishment and the functioning of the common market, including those relating to the direct taxation.
</seg>
<seg id=1642>
We see few words in these three sectors.
</seg>
<seg id=1643>
If there is still a model of behaviour that in cases of doubt all fighting, all this could set off by the winds the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe which is based on regional cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id=1644>
In the final analysis, we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia, also a cooperation on both sides.
</seg>
<seg id=1645>
Mr President, our group supports the work done by Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the viability of negotiation of the stabilisation and association agreements with the Republic of Croatia.
</seg>
<seg id=1646>
Mr President, over the years in which I was President of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, I had the opportunity to accompany many Croats in its efforts towards freedom and prosperity which they, like other peoples of our continent, identifying with their integration into the European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id=1647>
On the basis of the results obtained by Croatia this year, I have to say that I am confident that we will be able to achieve a rapid pace.
</seg>
<seg id=1648>
This is, of course, our criterion and the speed with which we have brought our policy towards Croatia in recent months confirms that.
</seg>
<seg id=1649>
We have a duty to Croatia to give his government and its people all kinds of aid in the coming years and we very much appreciate your wise advice to ensure that we continue to this path.
</seg>
<seg id=1650>
It is incomprehensible in this connection that the Laskar Jihad had the opportunity to go to the Moluccas this spring with thousands of supporters to exacerbate again the conflict.
</seg>
<seg id=1651>
In Timor, militias blocking the return of refugees and persons providing aid are asediadas.
</seg>
<seg id=1652>
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, I will confine myself to three points.
</seg>
<seg id=1653>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for the excellent work she has done.
</seg>
<seg id=1654>
It is not the only country in which this is happening.
</seg>
<seg id=1655>
The continuing violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh in Irian Jaya causes a great deal of pain to the population.
</seg>
<seg id=1656>
Tomorrow, we welcome here the ceremony of the award of the Sakharov Prize.

According to the most recent reports arrivals of the Indonesian archipelago is urgently needed, while the question of whether the situation does not seem even more serious, yes, more precarious, for the President Wahid and serves the enemies which the rapporteur analyses.
</seg>
<seg id=1658>
If we want to help Indonesia, must now act with money and facts and not just words.
</seg>
<seg id=1659>
I believe that the report is extremely valuable to shed light on what has been happening.
</seg>
<seg id=1660>
It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be solved overnight.
</seg>
<seg id=1661>
Protection of the Communities' financial interests
</seg>
<seg id=1662>
We must finally remove the obstacles to its independent activity, especially in the recruitment of staff and its structure.
</seg>
<seg id=1663>
That is why the Commission must finally fulfil through a process internal reforms your announcement that will not tolerate fraud and that each of them will be pursued consistently.
</seg>
<seg id=1664>
I believe that this must be exactly the consequence also of Nice.
</seg>
<seg id=1665>
We would like to see Member States open up negotiations have a uniform legislation in criminal matters, however, we do not want to put our countries to a public prosecutor federal community.
</seg>
<seg id=1666>
I would also like to know why was delayed until yesterday, after the Danish referendum on the euro, the publication of the Commission document on this issue.
</seg>
<seg id=1667>
I have tabled an amendment to mention the names of these countries, because it is high time to do so and shame.
</seg>
<seg id=1668>
I am sure that OLAF has an interest in shaping so transparent selection tables senior managers.
</seg>
<seg id=1669>
However, we in the European Parliament must be careful not to see the beam in our eye for being so focused in seeing the mote in its alien: that of the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1670>
We are trying to put out a fire and suffocate ourselves with the smoke.
</seg>
<seg id=1671>
And nobody can understand, I either.
</seg>
<seg id=1672>
With a view to achieving fully that purpose, I would like to highlight four questions which I consider to be fundamental in the work of the authority of budgetary control.
</seg>
<seg id=1673>
The Treaty is a problem for Parliament itself.
</seg>
<seg id=1674>
Commissioner, it is worrying that we should explicitly to draw the attention of the Commission on respect for the rights of Members as guardian of the Treaties.
</seg>
<seg id=1675>
Relate to a number of guidelines for the action that the Committee on Budgetary control can continue when find problems in different areas, including the recommended to the Committee on Budgets that freeze or reduce the amount of the appropriations intended for the items in question in the budget for the following year; not authorise transfers of appropriations involving the increase in appropriations affected for certain period until they have completed internal investigations additional; to ask the President of the Commission to demand the resignation of any Commissioner affected by the serious problems: discovered something like a cesárea of the EU.
</seg>
<seg id=1676>
The report demands that are made detailed inventories of operational activities, a strict monitoring of budget lines and irregularities as well as an internal assessment of the results by the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1677>
Commissioner, the starting point for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.
</seg>
<seg id=1678>
But the result of this common position would, if not amended, which in the end not only would not have the same weapons on America but even within Europe.
</seg>
<seg id=1679>
I do not know why it should not be achieved in the present case, as has been achieved for all the other directives, ultimately arrive at a compromise.
</seg>
<seg id=1680>
It is a proposal which has had a long, and I fear that, stormy way to overcome some of the difficulties that exist.
</seg>
<seg id=1681>
The first amendment relates to Article 4, stating what has to be the authority responsible for monitoring the supply.
</seg>
<seg id=1682>
We now have a proposal which would cause difficulties, pursuit of court more favourable possible disputes at a delicate moment of an agreement business.
</seg>
<seg id=1683>
In the UK the regulation of takeover bids through the voluntary code of practice administered by the group responsible for takeover bids has produced very good results: a good example here a pragmatic approach an extremely complex issue in which legislation would be less appropriate.
</seg>
<seg id=1684>
But, more than that, it is better that we can manage the Lisbon Programme of creating a competitive European economy and dynamic.
</seg>
<seg id=1685>
In the European Parliament what we must do is to regulate in a way minimum at European level the major areas which cause tension on the right of acquisitions, for example, presidency towards shareholders, major shareholders against small companies or against capital market.
</seg>
<seg id=1686>
Some amendments proposed by Parliament further improve the text of the Council' s common position. as a result, their points focus attention on issues which could lead to difficulties in the interpretation and are to a more rapid transformation of the directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1687>
After all, it is not proven in any way that the proposed definition price of better than any other, since different definitions used at the moment in the Member States work all very well.
</seg>
<seg id=1688>
The debate is closed.
</seg>
<seg id=1689>
Furthermore, it acknowledges the artist a right of information to be aware of their rights within a period of up to three years before traders professional cultural objects, what is reasonable, because they have to wear the accounting purchases and sales.
</seg>
<seg id=1690>
Consequently here, the legislator, Austrian and not attack the European legislator that only creates framework conditions positive for artists and auction houses.
</seg>
<seg id=1691>
In addition, the issue at hand, the need for a common position is all the greater because only a common position will enable the European Union influence at international level so that it can defend the interests of authors at global level.
</seg>
<seg id=1692>
I trust in the wisdom and wisdom of this House.
</seg>
<seg id=1693>
In Germany, for example, of the 7,000 artists who transferred their rights in 1998 only 274 actually obtained any money for it and 40% of droit de suite was intended to cover the costs for collecting the sum.
</seg>
<seg id=1694>
In short, it is not necessary harmonisation of this kind in this sector.
</seg>
<seg id=1695>
Had already been rejected at first reading a similar amendment.
</seg>
<seg id=1696>
Have thought that the translations could continue despite this timetable rather tight and difficult.
</seg>
<seg id=1697>
However, we have reached the point where, unfortunately, we can no longer postpone this any further.
</seg>
<seg id=1698>
Our committee proposes that it be brought forward a year.
</seg>
<seg id=1699>
This Parliament is, of course, in favour of these values and will continue to defend them.
</seg>
<seg id=1700>
Technology and the development of the markets will cause the change in any case.
</seg>
<seg id=1701>
There is no legal basis for exclude competition in such cases.
</seg>
<seg id=1702>
A reduction of universal services - the very essence of the postal service sector - up to 50 grammes would seriously undermine the ability of the servers national postal to provide a universal service at an affordable rate for all irrespective of where they live.
</seg>
<seg id=1703>
I would remind my Conservative colleagues the mess in which ran into the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British Post Office.
</seg>
<seg id=1704>
We have turned the safety net for users of postal services in a hamaca where it tumban big business post to continue with what they have always done.

For this reason, the European Commission has not proposed the total liberalisation of postal services in the second phase.

This is something that I wish the other European countries.

In the Dutch newspapers, Mr Bolkestein cast in view recently to the French its position anti-liberal, or at least that appeared in the holder of a newspaper.

Madam President, Commissioner, what has taught us the debate, or rather the controversy sparked by Commissioner Bolkestein in their quest for a liberalisation of postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and violated rules laid down by this directive? that using progressive terms and that we value, such as modernisation, liberalisation, accompanying of technological development, is a regression of social quality of a country.
</seg>
<seg id=1714>
The protection provided for universal services through a compensation fund which would use private profits for public services cannot be permanent.

<seg id=1715>
These limits and delays have contributed to a debate in which it is often confuse the ends with the instruments.
</seg>
<seg id=1716>
Madam President, in dealing with this issue we are talking about economic and social cohesion.
</seg>
<seg id=1717>
Madam President, first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur Mr Ferber because, of course, has done a complicated work, difficult, where he had to try to find a balance between proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival completely different.
</seg>
<seg id=1718>
I fear that the effect will be that the current monopoly can strengthen further its position at the taxpayers' expense and to rejoin the standard for the new applicant.
</seg>
<seg id=1719>
I am also pleased to see that our Liberal friends of the continent are an example to the British Liberal.
</seg>
<seg id=1720>
I certainly accept that the concept of liberalisation per se has nothing wrong and which can be beneficial for consumers.
</seg>
<seg id=1721>
Justified, as it is included in the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which place the completion of the internal market for the free movement of goods and services in an environment of competition.
</seg>
<seg id=1722>
Universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and everything we do is designed to create the right conditions for improvement.
</seg>
<seg id=1723>
Special services are another important areas in which must be promoted innovation and modernisation.

He said that the opening up to competition of almost all of the postal market seems inevitable before the end of the decade.

<seg id=1726>
That is why I cannot remain silent and not will remain silent while the future of the sector is threatened by the inability of properly overcome the challenges us that all that in Lisbon.
</seg>
<seg id=1727>
Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.
</seg>
<seg id=1728>
I would like to remind you that this common organisation of the markets has as its main objective guaranteed access to the Community market for their products.
</seg>
<seg id=1729>
It is absolutely necessary to find, over and above the tariff preference EUR 300, a means to enable them to effective access to the quota C and evaluate so that followed the impact of the system on these producers.
</seg>
<seg id=1730>
For example, we cannot fail to express our concern about the banana production in certain ACP countries, in the small producer countries of the West Indies and in some countries of the West Africa which have been traditional suppliers of the banana market with whom we have commitments that we should not forget.
</seg>
<seg id=1731>
I therefore ask that this report is supported in its entirety by the Members of this House, as it was in the Committee on Agriculture.
</seg>
<seg id=1732>
While the United States first condemn periods of historical reference, and now defend their own periods of historical reference.

<seg id=1734>
Sometimes seems as if the Commission, in the proposals deregulation in trade and agricultural production at international level, outside even further than the Cairns Group.
</seg>
<seg id=1735>
It is a pity that the Commission and the Council persist in a solution that can seriously compromising this production, particularly after 2006.
</seg>
<seg id=1736>
The successive opinions of the WTO does not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.
</seg>
<seg id=1737>
Thus, the transitional period should be almost fifteen years and never less than ten and compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the departure of production in the outermost regions, which means that they should be included aid undertakings marketing bananas there produced.
</seg>
<seg id=1738>
I hope that today will listen to our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, albeit EUR 300, may prove to be rather pointless at the facts as ACP producers will be laminados by the so-called "system in order of arrival."

As you rightly said, transatlantic relations have intensified dramatically in the last ten years, above all, it is true, by the United States, thanks to President Clinton, but I believe that history will note that these new relations has also contributed Europe, which has played a key role in its development, through the 1990 transatlantic declaration and through the new transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.

<seg id=1765>
In short, it will be important to achieve a change of direction and draw up a genuine transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.

In conclusion, I refer to the Dominican Republic, which says that was supposed to the WTO should become an impartial referee of common rules, in which countries could learn to act according to the rules.

The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
</seg>
<seg id=1770>
These objectives, the primary and secondary, will be the litmus test with those who have to judge the specific proposals put forward by the Commission.
</seg>
<seg id=1771>
We know that a solution - installation in one country with the possibility of providing services throughout the Union - could enable an avalanche in those countries with lower taxation.
</seg>
<seg id=1772>
Thus, in 1992 we achieved an agreement, then considered minimum harmonisation, according to which the normal rate of VAT could not be less than 15% and the Member States had the power to implement one or more rates not less than 5%, in this case with derogations laid down.
</seg>
<seg id=1773>
We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there are no distortions of the market and that this report on the results to the Council and Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id=1774>
In short, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the method is unreasonable and if we really want to promote the e-economy in Europe, a signal would be appropriate to set a zero rate of VAT for our companies operating through the network instead try to impose our problems to others.

The CDs are not so archaic and it would be necessary to impose a tax, while the programmes circulating on the Internet would fall outside of the imposition of a rate.

However, the solution proposed is intended to be technically unworkable and to create restrictions to the promotion of transactions on the Internet in the Union, precisely when all its promise expansion.

The tax on kerosene can only be introduced, therefore, by means of an international consensus which will enable us to guarantee equality of competition.

I particularly welcome the fact that the report strengthens one of the key arguments I made in my report on behalf of the Committee on Transport and which was put to the vote in this Parliament a few months ago, namely that given that certainly is politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should seek alternatives tools to achieve the same effect, including a rate for emissions.
</seg>
<seg id=1788>
In fact, the industry provides 100% of its infrastructure costs through charges air traffic control and airport, which in 1998 were raised to a total of USD 4,000 million; unlike other modes of transport, such as rail and road, which are still heavily subsidised.
</seg>
<seg id=1789>
The current situation is not favourable.
</seg>
<seg id=1790>
In this context it has to be said, unfortunately, that emissions from air traffic are a problem which, although not in percentage terms is too large, is increasing very and therefore not,.

<seg id=1794>
Bearing in mind that the debate within the Council still continues and the Commission' s desire to settle properly the issue of VAT and electronic commerce in the short term, I think that the best thing at the moment is not formally accept Parliament' s proposals for amendments, but making them a reality as far as possible through negotiations within the Council.

<seg id=1795>
For this reason, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.

To bring to fruition the development of the ambitious European programme e-Contenidos we need to simplify and consolidate from the point of view of safety procedures involved.
</seg>
<seg id=1831>
That is why the objective of the public support measures for the promotion of the content industry of the EU must also be the achievement of a high level of culture and the diversification of the same.
</seg>
<seg id=1832>
On the other hand, are communication networks, which need content to fill endlessly its virtual area, and consider the obvious subordination of content, their purchase, its use without special attention to the rules of production.
</seg>
<seg id=1833>
Mr President, I very much welcome the programme on digital content in Europe and I would like to highlight two points.
</seg>
<seg id=1834>
That is why I support the amendments calling for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.
</seg>
<seg id=1835>
First, on the social and cultural function of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasis on the social and cultural dimension of digital content.
</seg>
<seg id=1836>
Assessment and management of environmental noise
</seg>
<seg id=1837>
Indeed, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats and, incidentally, also part of the Liberal Group, have given to this particular amendment to reduce aircraft noise.
</seg>
<seg id=1838>
This year alone, six years later the dates mentioned above, and under strong pressure from the French Government, the Commission has presented a proposal to establish indicators harmonised noise.
</seg>
<seg id=1839>
This proposal is, in fact, quite moderate, bearing in mind that the Scandinavian countries already have stricter rules than those proposed for the year 2012.
</seg>
<seg id=1840>
Orly Schiphol, Barcelona and other airports already comply with strict measures.
</seg>
<seg id=1841>
Another important point which we propose to incorporate and that it will be essential in the context of the problem of aircraft noise is the definition of noise other indicators of in addition to those that the rapporteur has pointed out.
</seg>
<seg id=1842>
Due to a lack of common rules in the European Union, we have seen situations glaring distortion of competition between airports and a lack of fairness between the citizens of the various Member States.
</seg>
<seg id=1843>
That is why the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange seem to me to be very important.
</seg>
<seg id=1844>
Mr President, first of all, I must say that I welcome this report.
</seg>
<seg id=1845>
This was in fact the purpose of amendment No 36, although I believe that the idea has not yet been developed in depth.
</seg>
<seg id=1846>
We should look at this aspect and then adopt in both areas a combined approach, setting out on the one hand limit values for the various sources of emissions and noise, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions.
</seg>
<seg id=1847>
We need more time and I regret that we have not had, although in general terms, I support the framework directive.
</seg>
<seg id=1848>
Once the Member States have given comparable information, the Commission will examine the issue of introducing limit values and other Community measures to reduce the number of people who are affected by noise, and will submit a report to the Council and Parliament.

Then, it also transpired that the Commission did not have the necessary instruments to act properly.

Tomorrow we have in the programme another stage, when the next move will be to our colleague Marit Paulsen, of the Liberal Group, who will have the opportunity to qualified even more the directive before us.

The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument to ensure the correct implementation of Community legislation on animal feed and, in the event of emergencies arise in third countries, to take measures without delay.

We know that the majority of Europeans live in cities, and until now, these issues have been in embryonic stage as regards the cities.

The multiannual programme 2000-2004 to sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for this purpose, as well as the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordination and development actions.

The Court of justice of the European Communities and even the bodies of conflict resolution WTO consider that sometimes the precautionary principle applies environmental and public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as shown by the unfinished business of the cheeses drawn up with fresh milk.

The aim must not be limiting or compensation of damage, but the primary goal must be to prevent damage to health or the assets of persons.

<seg id=1864>
Already in 1996, the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of animal meal throughout the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle; although only for that.

There has never been and never will be, a certainty absolute scientific on the new substances or on new products.

Finally, if we want the application of the precautionary principle to be effective and credible, it is essential to the participation of all interested parties, including the representatives of civil society, in political decision-making surrounding its implementation
</seg>
<seg id=1867>
And, finally, that public health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly economic.
</seg>
<seg id=1868>
An essential condition for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concern about the possible harmful effects will provide a scientific basis.

Mr President, in the absence of other results, the negotiations that took place in Nice will have made clear the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id=1897>
In this respect the tone of the joint resolution is too simplistic.
</seg>
<seg id=1898>
The backwardness of the publication of the written conclusions - which are not yet officially available at the moment, four days later - demonstrates the difficulty of draw up clear decisions taken in confusion.

In the really important issues such as taxation, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration, everything is as before.

<seg id=1904>
What is striking in the debate on Nice is the impression at the end of the Treaty does not father or mother and child is anyone: the French presidency in desdobló apologise, instead of accepting clearly the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups which correspond to the governments of the Member States multiplicaron criticism.

But this Parliament also fought for this reduction in resources for the innovative policies were offset using the flexibility instrument laid down in a clause of the budget estimate.

We all have a part to play in this important area because, in the market truly global in which we are already, new ideas - with adequate resources, and with a firm support and realistic - will mean that in Europe we can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular.
</seg>
<seg id=1910>
In the previous speech already were harsh words against budgets, and that is that EUR 400 million is really the minimum funding, so in the second part of the exercise we must seize the opportunities for additional funding which offers the flexibility instrument, as has been pointed out in the report.
</seg>

In my opinion, this will accompany automatically, and not as concludes the report, a reduction of European added value.

In accordance with the usual procedure for complaints, we cannot do this public response, although we can say in broad outline what he says.

<seg id=1934>
One aspect of the Euratom Treaty is the transport of radioactive waste between Member States, but, of course, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and all contaminated waste will be a part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any Member State of the European Union.
