High Representative is, in contrast to the Commission - is not independent, but its role is to coordinate foreign and security policies which fall within the competence of the Member States, and we certainly need the intergovernmental greater priority.
He has expressed the wish that the Presidency in Nice is showing the way forward.
It is indeed a broader and better result wish, frankly, I believe that we have made a good start.
I therefore hope that the European Council in Nice vote in favour of this project and will decide as a specific project, not as a fait accompli, which, of course, once the necessary reforms have been adopted.
However, I also specifically referred to the fact that we are today a reality very important objectives of the Community method can be achieved, for example, now more effective action in the Balkans.

Mr President, I, as I have already during the debate, in other words, before the vote, have made it clear to vote for the Skinner report, because I venture capital and consider very important.
My colleague Armonia Bordes yesterday made it absolutely clear that only a minority of Community funds and pension to cover Unternehmerrisiken use.
Consequently, the Charter is designed more to present itself retrograde practices of the nation states to reaffirm than real progress.
Mr President, here, at last, is a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen on the table, in which a whole article, Article 25, which devoted to elderly people.
But if he gave legally binding and incorporated into the Treaty would like the European Parliament, it would inevitably time to achieve the harmonisation of national law of the various European countries, and would make the Court gave disproportionate power centralised European institutions has been strengthened and independent powers of discretion of each people would be restricted.
· overloading the Charter detailed rules should be brought to an end and the secondary law remain.
I am going to vote for a different charter, and I am demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz and in Nice on 7 December 2000 involved.
Progress of the 12 candidate countries towards accession
I believe that a number of Member States not yet understood that this context and that the slow progress of the IGC difficulties, the extension period required to impose.
All of this, what I have said, we will be permanently only prevail if the applicant countries and in the European Union's policy and elites’ - and limited context, I agree with you, Commissioner, finally to promote the enlargement of the European Union itself useful.
This is a general principle.
Let me now turn to the second objective of the Presidency in this six-month period will make progress on the enlargement process.
I therefore suggest that you in this direction with the idea that we work in 2003 must consider what candidates are ready to join us on this date.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.
It is in any case in the negotiations for the 'if' only 'how' and 'when'.
But that the prospect of membership of the European Union, they hope for the solidarity of the European people and because they are political and economic firmly anchored offered.
A number of countries in the second economic criterion of competitiveness in the internal market made good progress quickly approaching the stage when they will be ready for accession.
We are therefore seeking engst possible coordination with the programmes of the national governments, the European Parliament and other institutions.
Every year, and will soon, on 8 November, once again, to be the case, in each of the candidate countries with very great interest in the Commission's judgment on the progress that has been made expected of them.
It is quite right that we are in favour of the principle of differentiation decided, each candidate in accordance with its progress and services assessment.
This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta, the best secure future for all of us in Europe in the East and in the West.
This is a matter of paramount importance, but the public little attention is paid.
Many believe that lightheartedly the fall of the Berlin Wall until enlargement ever remained the same: five years.
The next obvious opportunity in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament in 2009, but we want to try to as many countries as possible can join in 2004.
In addition, there are six substantive issues on which we are due to the method applied concerns.
In fact, the elected model of European unification itself, the simultaneous participation of all sectors, regardless of the traditions and characteristics of those involved in this impasse.
'This is in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s almost feel articulated in general shape, for all of us to date commitment.
But clearly for calling a spade a spade, cannot join the cut-price.
It is a great and, at the same time, fine idea that we do not enlargement make against the public and the best way to enlargement in accordance with the public to carry out their participation in the elections, because they are expressions of democracy and a form of involvement of citizens in the political system.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment briefly on the conditions for a scenario that was wanted by several parties.
I would be very surprised if they would make no pressure.
But I had already pointed out that all countries are approaching the stage when they will be ready for accession relatively quickly.
In other words, the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products already agreed without Poland is concerned, so that the Polish agriculture collapses.

Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, the biggest and most important, but, as we know, at the same time, the problematic countries preparing for accession to the European Union, which, it is such a host of problems, even rumours about a possible Poland’s exclusion from the first group, the Group of the first candidate countries.
As Poland and the eastern, former communist countries to many promises that we have not been kept.
We can only point again and again in the Czech Republic, which is discovered the Roma problem.
Slovakia was not referred to the second group, and consequently it wants to join at the same time as the Czech Republic.
Finally, at the same time, I would like to make one comment on domestic policy.
Thirdly, as regards agriculture, the productivity are still in the European Union, it will be necessary to complete the agricultural markets for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and distribution structures and increasing the profits they need to open up capital.
Bulgaria keen to accession to the European Union and NATO.

The Commission should not, in this respect were left out in the cold.
The candidate countries strive for a rapid economic growth, even if this is at the expense of a conservation that have already been established.
It came to an exchange of bad habits, including in the area of health.
Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united Europe.
The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in the field of transport and trans-European networks is responsible, are aware of the need for the various sectoral policies in favour of an overall planning to coordinate.
Previously, however, I would like to say that the transport infrastructure of central importance for the success of enlargement.
Mr President, I agree with the forthcoming enlargement of the EU is the greatest challenge to see.
In the former planned economies in Central and Eastern Europe to the traditional social values considerable pressure.
The PPE Group would responsibility for Beitrittstempo does not fall to the candidate countries because we cannot fix accession.

The conditions for membership is complying with the basic criteria of Copenhagen.
We have heard much about the benefits of enlargement, but this is an area in which we can learn from Lithuania.

I would ask you to Nice setting a date how soon you most advanced candidate countries, without anonymous, intend to put an end to the negotiations.

The political vision remains.
I am delighted the wishes of Klaus Hänsch noted, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission, a genuine assessment of the impact of enlargement and the economic consequences will, if not enlargement.
However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, there are no transitional periods in the interests of both parties do not go, just as a Member for a border region as Mrs Schierhuber a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border has, I think it is a concern that the creation of a joint short-term economic areas without any major problems can be tackled and a positive result on both sides.
There are three points I should like to underline one point as a Social Democrat.
The questions of the first pillar containing EEA granted to the economies of the candidate countries access to the internal market, science and youth exchange programmes legal commits the EU as long as it is not their system of agricultural aid to be extended to those countries. That will mean the EEA agreement boost that, in particular, for the economies of the candidate countries, they need growth, their society for accession to prepare, as well as for the economy of the EU, when assessing the cost of enlargement on economic growth even represent two-thirds EWR-Modell may be even more.
Secondly, you adopt the big bang, idea, many of the candidate countries at the same time, this would contradict the principle that each country should include its progress accordingly.
Thirdly, we must do everything we can to 2003, the European Union, in terms of the excellent speech by the President of the Commission Prodi preparing for enlargement.
I should like to link the relationship between Parliament and the Council to address the reference now considerable delays in answering questions in writing.
It is a worry that this is done in a country that wishes to join the European Union.
I request that the report be referred back to committee, in which the necessary steps should be prepared.
Mr President, today we are going to a total of three reports on this subject, including two of me to debate and vote on it may be.
This would at all stages of the food chain beneficial effects.
Safe food mean in the whole chain costs.
We must therefore Mrs Paulsen and the Commission accept and incorporate mixing, so that animal feed will be safer and the genuine consumer protection.
The 1999 directive was well thought out, and it is already a success, because burdens could be reduced proven.
But simply allow confusion is not the solution.
Very briefly, we need to Amendment No 37 on the dioxin press.
On this point we agree.
As a result, we, as European consumers still meat, milk and their derivatives buy on the world markets are by no means the European Union set limit values are emerging and appropriate feed produced, which means a system whereby resources obtained on the world market, where each substance or any mixed preparation freely before the products in the territory of the European Union to be introduced.
Until second reading, the Commission envisaged risk assessment methods informed.
On the other hand, it would be very serious if, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40 were to be adopted, because the Member States are no longer able to exist newly discovered risks intervene quickly.
Consumer protection already starts with the animal feed Futtermittelinhaltsstoffen declaration and, finally, the official controls.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by my colleague, Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is an important issue, as all the important issues is a highly controversial.
The debate on the excellent report by Mrs Paulsen, we have before us today was in some respects strongly marked feeling, and following the current debate, we must assume that the animal feed industry apply strict requirements of quality mixtures, however, subsequently changed.
Each of these three proposals, both individually and in the joint working together to remove the main shortcomings to contribute to the dioxin crisis revealed.
Amendment No 33 the re-exportation of Futtermittelpartien requirements of this directive are not sufficient to prevent exporting.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which propose that the possibility of dilution contaminated feed, under certain conditions to reinstate it.
This should be sufficient to our commitment, given that we, in the context of the new proposal on the establishment of a European Food Authority will be a system for the rapid exchange of information will manage to cover the whole of the food and feed chain.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, this directive on traffic compound feedingstuffs concealed in fact our old problem, namely the question of open declaration.
I am already gain this morning.
Indeed, if we were to do that, if we were to implement quickly and promptly go through the codecision procedure, which is certainly a great asset, and I am sure that we have the Council to very strong and united.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in future it may appear, at least it does not rule out the possibility of contaminated feed materials coming into animal feed.
The BSE crisis was the worst most well-known example.
As our rapporteur has already said that it would be best if we label open declaration would have been the ingredients list.
I believe that the professional qualifications and the decision of the Committee on Agriculture, in terms of agriculture, and therefore also in terms of animal feed is out of the question, in terms of practical and workable solution of farmers and consumers should be understood and applied.
So far, the positive part.
I believe that this is a legitimate right to information, which we must take into consideration.
On behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, I would like to ask you, Madam President, that the families of the victims and the local authorities of Brittany and Marín, Galicia, where most of the victims come to convey the condolences of the House.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
- Is anyone oppose the tabling of this oral amendment?
Indeed, the rapporteur states that the situation.
Most of the technical proposals deserve our firm support, for example in the field of food safety, the closure of the nuclear power stations in the first generation, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping, the code of conduct necessary for Eastern business from the West and much more. This is enormous and it is therefore vital.
At the same time, there are still considerable difficulties, particularly in the area of the budget.
Enlargement 13 countries not only changed the geopolitical context of the European Union, but also changed the structure, because, on the one hand, the population will increase (plus 28%), but also the number of 'less-favoured regions'.
In this respect, it is important to recognise that the candidate countries a competitive agricultural and food-processing sectors because of its high social and economic importance for the successful Transformations- and restructuring process will be crucial.
In this regard, I would like to express the hope that far more remote regions, six out of seven still the ten poorest count of the EU Structural Fund resources are not only because of the BIP-Kriteriums, but also because of geographical, demographic and, above all, social indicators receive.
In the light of this Europe, in the interests of the people of France, we reject its enlargement to include the countries and peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, just exempt from communist dictatorship and do not know what totalitarian and technocratic event move trap, do not agree with good conscience.
We should have the country reports and at most a short but lucid resolution leave.
The system currently practised subsidies, subsidies and quotas must free trade and adapting to the market should be replaced.
The significance and scope of the problems created by enlargement cannot be reconciled with the doublespeak mentioned in the European Union.
The enlargement of the Union to speak for me not to say membership of some countries to Europe to confirm or not.
Our neighboring over the last ten years embraced the necessary effort to satisfy the entry criteria.
Latvia has its place in this House, not only because he sees progress as a whole is entitled to this' trust, give a successful conclusion such negotiations is essential, but above all, because Europe at home.
I believe that Poland is the state of all the candidate countries most of our support and deserves our commitment, because without the extremely important initiatives Poland’s communism would not be overthrown, and we would not be here today to deal with this problem.

I would appeal to Prague, this sign of this request that this request for dialogue to take and to meet together with this House to ensure that this legacy to overcome nationalism era.

The report's position is clearly hard, as always, a solution to the problem of settlers might look like land extremely difficult for both sides.

In view of the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot community and Turkey will not be an easy task.

In committee, I had the opportunity to me to oppose experts to speak any NGOs’ belong.
We also welcome largely Richtlinienbestimmung whereby equal treatment for people with disabilities means that appropriate adjustments in the workplace as long as companies.
Only in this way can we create discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe fought effectively.
All in all, teach us the great Anglo-Saxon democracies that racism and discrimination, with the help of liberal democracy, and not by limiting and gradual weakening of freedom of expression, freedom of expression, freedom of association and the economic freedoms combated.

New Caledonia because of the colour to enjoy advantages.
Together with the recently adopted directive is 2 000 orientation of this directive is the desire expressed by the European Union demonstrate stand up for an open society patterns, and in particular the European history deep stigma of racism is free.
So those who say here in this Parliament, the values that we all want to defend, did not a European directive to be laid down are wrong.
This is a hard-won success should not be violated.
Finally, the media is a major role in this task.

The second category is aimed at the text of the Commission proposal to clarify the content, while the third many amendments to this proposal in line with the directive adopted last June should be brought against racial discrimination.
In particular, in Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 proposes that the reference to discrimination on the grounds of racial and ethnic origin to be deleted.

I have the demands of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is unable to support it.
It is and remains primarily up to the legislation of the Member States, but a consensual agreement on certain parameters in dialogue with all interested parties at European level are far from being excluded.
In the current conditions, I think it is up to the parents, their children at this type of programmes to protect.
Parents are in this area is particularly dependent on aid, which must include the following: parameters for the protection of minors in the media in the entire area of the European Union, the establishment and cost-effective availability of filters, legislation on the protection of minors and the responsibility of media companies and operators in the private sector and in the public sector.
If Ausschussdebatten some say that there is no evidence of the negative impact of the various forms of violence on television on children, I am surprised and believe that this is a fatal trivialisation.
With regard to the introduction of Selbstkontroll-Kodex mainly technical point of view, it should be noted that broadcasters in some Member States already Kontrollcode television have produced, enabling parents to eliminate television.
The debate is closed.
In particular, my report is commendable generalisations returning the decision-making powers of the Member States replaced.

I am thinking in particular of violence against women, one of the priorities of my governance, and I know that this is an issue that you have a very special concern.
We know that the measures to reconcile work and family life favoring women in particular, if there is a lack of studies on the situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is no longer the traditional role as society has changed greatly and her family.
Sometimes some people seem to some Members of this House to think that, but that is not true.
Mr President, I would like to finish by stressing that equality within their own confines begins.
Such a position is worrying and vague, and I believe that the projects you have provided consideration, because it is not certain that this practical implementation reach.
In this area there is no equality.
The image of European women, as our reports that results from our directives are not in line with the Danish women, the majority of the euro resist.
So I think it is significant that the report reaffirms in all areas of society, for example in the labour market, zahlenmäßiges balance must be struck between men and women.
For that reason, it is a missed opportunity, in this report, marriage and the family completely ignored.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities more heed.
We have heard that the previous presidency only Gleichstellungsministerium restructured and abolished.
The average wage women’s average 28% less than men, which will help women most of the poor population and their participation in social and political life more difficult.
It is truly excellent.
Across Europe is taking place today is a process of impoverishment of working women in France, where 15% of them less than 3 650 francs per month for life.
Not all countries have been able to follow your example and I hope that the example of France in other countries will bear fruit.
The history of women goes back far more clearly.
The applicant country - must be the adoption of the acquis really help.
However I need your help.

- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had at the time the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, religion or (not sectarian) belief, disability, age or sexual orientation welcomed.
The problems of certain minorities in those countries, all aware of this.
For the reasons behind the amendment is absolutely clear, so that seeks to combat the Member States age to proceed relevant provisions but entwicklungspsychologischen reasons are fully justified and Beschäftigungsleben any significance.
I also think that everything in a new Article 12 (a) script verzichtbar.

In its communication, the Commission recognises the problem, but no practical action, because it is the idea of the liberalisation of the market and competition were arrested. We all its proposals go in fact, especially for children, harsh reality of the unaccountability of multinational companies will be over their profitability is indifferent to what their programmes and products, and any parents’ responsibility alone, even the acquisition of new products to be encouraged to protect their children.
As the rapporteur, I am also of the opinion that the measures for the protection of young people from harmful violent programmes and no longer to restrict the traditional television, but for all media must apply.
An average of three hours per day, apart from television and sleeping in their own, for adults, in addition to the work, the most important human activity.
Furthermore, women are often occupied 'flexible' jobs, temporary contracts and low wages are typical of the sectors in which mainly women are employed.

B5-0792/2000) by the Members Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.

We must do everything in its power to Peru with candidates can achieve the goal of the challenge and able to the Peruvian people call for political renewal and substantial democracy to fulfil.
The joint debate is closed.
We now know that Afghanistan is not far from Afghanistan is the biggest producer of opium in the world, so that we can imagine what the role of this policy, albeit not only political - mafias play in the expansion of drug trafficking.
The Commission will take stock of the humanitarian aid programmes for the benefit of the Afghan people, to ensure that nobody on the ground are forgotten.
This conflict brings untold suffering.
For many years, there is a budget line during clearance and prevention programmes financed.
At this point I would like to make a reference Mrs Paciotti, I have to say that, of course, still within the Commission will ask what resources for mine clearance done and done.
B5-0794/2000 by the honourable Members, Mr Medina Ortega, Linksohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction of the guerrillas negotiations in the Spanish Jesuits in Colombia;
We all regret this and would want to stop talking about Colombia need.
The Commission has already offered measures of this package to be coordinated. the Commission has already envisaged in the next few days, give considerable funds for this.
Once again, therefore, double standards, which I find regrettable.
In particular I fail to understand the attitude of the Albanian opposition, refuses to recognise a necessary solution Albanians in Macedonia.
I think it is an extraordinary achievement of the Macedonians in their country together clearly.
That is why I believe that this reconciliation procedure, but the government, with great courage, a solution to the Universitätsfrage and many other issues has been found, needs visible signs of success and needs strong support, otherwise it will pose a threat to peace in the region as a whole.
The national programme within the framework of the PHARE resources allocated for the year 2000 to support the university in the next academic year - 2001 and 2002, will be used.

As all these problems Greece is concerned, the biggest shipping sector in the European Union has relate basically the safety of all types of transport throughout the Union.
In the last few years in our waters far more people have lost their lives, not only by large ferry, but all too often in our Fischereikommunen.
On the contrary, innocent victims must be used now, so that the shipowners its objectives in the broadest sense prevail.
We must be clear that the credibility of the European Union.
Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of European legislation on the safety of passenger is a matter of the highest priority in the European Union should be, and that it is essential to ensure that these laws throughout the Community, rigorous and uniformly applied.
Please excuse me, I am for reasons which you are sufficiently known, it will be too late. I would like to make a brief statement on the two items on the agenda of the issue, the situation in Belgrade and the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general and the situation in the Middle East.
Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, as Mr Solana on the two issues to speak this afternoon on our agenda, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
We must be prepared to fulfil that promise, as soon as the will of the people is respected.
Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I am participating in this debate is not entirely without any reservations, but I did not want to our Parliament, given the tragic consequences of the new explosion in the Middle East, just a month in this Chamber as optimistic expectations now only act as judge, who has the power to this particular condemnation.
Madam President, I think my contribution today is not based on various Fernanalysen but on my own experience of last week, as I was accidentally in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, when it came to the outbursts.
As a opponents of the use of force by the Israelis and the Palestinians are not on the same footing.
I would like to Parliament in this crucial moment to call upon a declaration of solidarity with the brave people to adopt today in the streets of Belgrade, defending the freedom of the same solidarity that we Europeans a few years ago, the people of other capital cities could be given also fighting for their freedom.
The Europeans would doubtless well in this House by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, opportunity to take grasp.
The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.
For years, he has succeeded, with its propaganda machine has been and violent pressure on the media to deceive people in his own country, but unfortunately many in the western world from a false picture of reality vorzuspiegeln.
As the curtain falls to this tragedy, it is the duty of this Parliament as a symbol of a free Europe en masse to support the Yugoslav parliament and Mr Koštunica perceptions and fulfilling its mandate to help.
This is the unrelenting attitude leaves at the same time, fear the worst, and the events of this moment to underline those words I noted a couple of hours ago.
I wonder whether the Commissioner on this point is already planning steps to show that we are Koštunica really the legally elected representatives of the Serbian people and consider as a partner with which the European Union today.
The European Parliament wishes to him in this historic moment, because the tyranny falters and democracy triumphed, assure you its full solidarity.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision Amendment 24 2000/EC concerning the extension of the Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects in Croatia [COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).
The parliamentary and presidential elections in that country taken new political rate is welcome.
It operates an advisory Task Force, which aims to Croatia their technical skills and provide help in the contract negotiations.
We must not forget that Croatia until recently the classic example of a totally failed Privatisierungsprogramms only a few benefits from privatisation. This whole process must be supported.
The contribution in the form of a EIB-Darlehens EUR 250 million for the period 2000 to 2007 not a milestone, befördernde aid.
So it is not entirely true, if this report talks about democratisation.
As Croatia and Slovakia’s half a century ago, for the first time, namely independent Hitler-Regimes servant.
We can, of course, the question of guarantees and the question of Croatia is not separated from the discussion yesterday evening in the development and see in Belgrade.
If it is the case that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed, we hope to practical inclusion of normal partnership between Serbia and our Union’s democracies only takes days.
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.
(The House rose and observed a minute 's silence)
My question is this: anyone who has the power on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute to speak?
I would ask you, Madam President, that all possible steps to ensure that the current procedure in the Committee on Petitions in more than thirty social groups and NGOs tabled protests petitioners speak out against the current situation in which Community rules on nuclear safety in flagrantly violated to speed up.
The Autopsy made in Georgia arise clearly murder, probably in connection with torture has acted.
We have the opportunity to your dream, moreover, do not think - a great piece point the way forward.
This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation genetically modified plants.
It is not a matter of clearly Fettnäpfchen to another.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)
The next item is the report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(INI)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Social Agenda.
The importance of this open method of coordination must be emphasised, however, does not mean that this method should replace the social legislation, because we in Europe also establish social rights, minimum social standards dare to formulate and social laws must be adopted within the framework of a single European market is needed.
We are calling in our opinion also for dialogue and cooperation with civil society and in particular women's associations in the countries which are currently in their accession to our European family prepare, because there in time, we need to take a harmonious development in theory and practice modelled on the rest of Europe follows.
With regard to the Commission communication listed fields is also consensus.
At this point I would like to remind you of a seminar on this issue will be held in Biarritz on 4 and 5 December, and I will guide.
With regard to the fight against exclusion on 17 October, we have the Council 'Employment and Social Affairs made a great deal of progress and appropriate objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which is defined as a basis for the national action plans are.
In some quarters, I have heard that emerge from this report diagnosis, but not the remedy prescribed agrees.
Technological development and new forms of organization certainly speak for a flexible cooperation, less rigid codes of conduct, but rather on results and objectives.
It is precisely in our eyes to the old-fashioned views due to those charged, a liberalised market do not expect him to regulate everything good.
The vital contribution to social tranquillity helped in our country and confidence in foreign investors strengthened.
The method chosen instead seems to me to be rather questionable.
If we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights and to speak of a European Constitution facing favourable, we must not be short-sighted, but must say that all necessary steps must be taken, even if it needs more accurate rules.
A critical point lack of initiatives on the new challenges in the field of health and safety at work, the involvement of employees and industrial relations.
Mr President, I would like the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister Péry this presentation of the social policy agenda congratulations.
We know that these points by the conservatives in Europe to be tackled, but we, in our group, attach particular importance.
The third conceptual feature of enlargement.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
The actions of the Commission should review the impact of access for individuals to medical care, social security and pension by definition and analysis of the shortcomings in the organisation of work, and perhaps the question of a general reduction in working hours should be added.
In this way, the women of Europe feel close, but also Europe's interesting and innovative ideas benefit from the commitment to this programme age.
We expect an annual report from the President of the Commission in the context of a debate to be held every year in the European Parliament.
I am also pleased that the improvement of the child care is provided, thereby reconciling work and family life easier.
My group will take this into account in its final vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In my opinion, the Commission's new approach very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005 well thought out.
I believe that reflect the many amendments supported by the common position of the Commission and the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities take in this matter.
On the one hand, I during the past year requests from various companies that receive a certain amount of powerlessness in connection with the investigation found, not least in those cases in which an appeal against the decision taken by the Commission in the Court of First Instance had to be lodged.
I would also like to take this opportunity and ask Commissioner Monti, when the implementation of a public, effective and efficient register on state aid is to be expected and, furthermore, when the already long prospects of receiving scoreboard implemented.
Furthermore, I would point out to Mr Monti that the gentleman in the next report greater space should be given.
What I said is true not only in the field of energy policy, but it also applies to other areas.
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work with the two reports complimentary assessment of the work of your person and the Directorate-General for Competition make done.
I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything, and in this sense not unlimited competition and should be.
Mr President, No one argues today - and I do not, of course, that the aid change the conditions of competition, and in that sense, of evil than the inefficiency of the favoring companies.
It was somewhat strange to hear that he is the reduction of state aid in the period 1994-1998 dispute, even though the Commission itself recognises this.
My opinion is, of course, XXIX and the Commission report on competition policy, but we will not fail to look to the past.
In the time available to me, I would like to mention three points: modernisation of Community competition law to work in 1999 to enforce the competition rules and, finally, the state aid.
The Commission has always opposed cartels and against the abuse of dominant positions intervened.
Mr Rapkay, the Commission attaches great importance to the support of its competition policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support is waning.
This system can either at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community activated provision during the third phase of economic and monetary union, only for the Member States with a derogation, in other words, at the moment, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden applies.
In the future, the use of the capital market, the only possible option remain.
I therefore ask that the report drafted the support of this House, and therefore in the area of Rebpflanzgutes the single market can be used.
That must be changed on the development of plant health rules and to scientific and technical progress was due, in particular, in-vitro-Vermehrung have been achieved.
By this precautionary principle also to the possibility of genetic changes referred, for example, the intensive use of pesticides should be reduced.
Finally, I would like to say that we, in the interest of the precautionary principle, if I have just mentioned articles and amendments unfortunately should not be withdrawn, as the wine growers demand the view of Marianne Isler Béguin and therefore follow the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and its removal would have to vote.
Mr President, if you will allow, Commissioner, could you your opinion on the amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy set out? Amendment No 1.
The only controversial point was whether I decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen immediately after his transfer by the French Government had to note or not.
I would remind you that this vote would take place at 12.30 p.m. in the first place.
In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the civil judicial cooperation.
The convention is its role fully to 19 November, the date of the next ministerial meeting to continue.
We need such a stimulating climate, as Mr Moscovici pointed out, and I have the Heads of State and Government, the great sense of common historic responsibility to a historic moment in the construction of Europe can exercise.
We only need to ensure that we are now in these matters of qualified majority voting, not behind the spirit or the climate of Biarritz fall.
It is the small countries are not the orders of the large countries of the European Union.
I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council, when it is clear that point would be.
On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica, an historic event.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, progress on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting has been achieved, but there are still profound differences concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have stressed.
It seems to us that we are moving in the opposite direction.
If you are not associated with closer cooperation, the freedom of Mitfahrers on the back seat a motor vehicle.
I do not wish to, even less so than you, interfere in Germany’s domestic affairs, but I think that this position is coherent and, moreover, in the direction desired by the Commission, if I am not mistaken.
We have an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue began, which shows that all the Member States maintain this ceiling support for enlargement.
This is certainly not the case.
Firstly, we sometimes had the impression that some obsession with Biarritz debate between small and large states dominated.
In this respect, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method should be maintained.
Even after the accession of the candidate countries today’s each Member State must Junior- or Seniorkommissar reserve.
The wording of Article 93 is problematic in view of the fact that the first successfully complete wave as well as impossible, progress towards achieving qualified majority.
The citizens of these countries must be the undoubted benefits that any new European Treaty brings convinced.
It would tiefliegenden causes of this crisis to deny, they would accept that for generations anxieties without new problems to a final settlement of the prerequisite for reconciliation, could place.
I am also concerned that only a very weak response to Parliament's demand for democratisation.
This could perhaps be reproached the forces of enlargement, the extensive reform demand.
On the one hand, the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government of Israel, the talks on violence in the region and freeze its efforts on the creation of a Notstandsregierung with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon to focus.
Of course, we were pleased unspeakable victory for the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Koštunica President noted.
I commend Mr Barón Crespo, his Italian colleagues reason to ask why it is in Italy, with a very communist party involved in government and other very communist party, the Partito della rifondazione Comunista preparing to take part in the parliamentary elections.
It should progress in the codecision procedure.
The Commission is the possibility of simple majority votes in the Commission more able to this momentum in the future.
Now the European Union not visionaries took the view of the year 2030 fixed, but people with solutions that are able to see the problems that within 3-8 years brings bewerkstelligende enlargement, and to find answers.
It is therefore a conditional outstanding work he has done, which does not set up or enforced.
The debate is closed.
Is this fundamental figurehead lost to understand at best, not more, and at worst will bring each other.
Democracy is better in Europe, European democracy recession.
The European Parliament has today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, a strong and simple statement: yes, you will be able to achieve the European Constitution that we want.
Consequently, the island sufficient criteria.
I am going to the heart of the matter, namely that I am by the main points of the report by the chairman Mr Gil-Robles focus, I would like to say that I find it excellent.
First of all, simplifying and clarifying the Treaties.
In this respect, I would like to leave it at that, because of the University of Florence, at least for me, not to the debate.
According to the information, it is now very technical, you will see that I ask, in the presidency, a clear majority languages in contrast to the Italian version of the implementation of the cohesion policy only to the least favoured islands and does not refer to the islands in general.
Mr Duhamel, I am sure you agree with me that, if the Treaty of Nice is not successful, no place, or at least no credibility for reflection on the future of European integration, at least not in the present framework.
It is also necessary, in this European Constitution, the division of responsibilities between the Member States and the European Union clearly define and the momentum of European integration in the areas involved, where it is essential to act together, as in the field of foreign and security policy.
It could also need to overcome continuing blockages.
We need to have a clearer distribution of responsibilities and a clearer subsidiarity.
As you know, there are very different in the various Member States, the various social forces.
The ultimate objective of a European constitution, however, unfortunately, this is exactly the opposite, and that is why we cannot accept it.
For the increased European house peoples in the military on monetary policy, and perhaps at the table tax and other standing on the sidelines.
The second version is clearly wrong, because the underdeveloped regions already covered by the Structural Funds and on the other hand, this interpretation no reason for the adoption of the Declaration No. 30 had.
Mr President, I shall be brief my modest 60 seconds to concentrate on the report by Olivier Duhamel, which is excellent because it really things stand, called the rapporteur's Lyrismus earlier finally convinced.
I believe that the unity of Europe will only be political.
We think that the new Constitution as early as the next European elections and available in force.
Consequently, the term 'most disadvantaged ", both in the island regions and applied to other areas, and the proposal made by Mr Barnier must, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna agreement, a revision of the Italian text to be made.
The debate is closed.
Because the honourable Member has said that she wanted to vote against this amendment lapses.
Mr President, we seem to be looking for a recipe for chaos.
- I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by Parliament, it sets high standards of quality and safety standards for derivatives of blood or plasma notes.
If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, would have the French authorities to lift the parliamentary immunity of Jean-Marie Le Pen Members must address.
I am very disappointed at the result of the vote of the European Parliament in the report on the transport of material for the vegetative propagation vines.
There are those who believe that alcohol, such as tobacco and drugs for a product for consumers and their neighbours do great damage to others, on the other hand, see in it a tool for creating jobs and bountiful source of income.
The rapporteur generally welcomes the White Paper proposals from the Commission on this issue, however, is concerned about the possible impact of the reform, the aim of which, in principle, the implementation of competition rules to decentralise.
In the debate yesterday evening, I congratulate Mr Jonathan Evans on his work, I had at the outset my clear criticism of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, if not ultra-liberal orientation comment in his report.
The linking this priority reoriented in the next three years, half of all new projects in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fields jobs being created in Objective 1.
In view of the indignation which trigger the consequences of this policy, sometimes succeed through state intervention, aid and other economic or tax incentives, the situation at least partly defused.
(The sitting was 14.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
In this way, we are now in October 2000, on the eve of the decision-making one’s 2001 budget.
The Council, however, does not prevent the total agricultural expenditure 555 million cut.
Furthermore, we believe that it is not, of course, 400 posts simply must be created simply obendrauf.
The Council, I can only say that you will follow us.
That is why the administration of this House to the Members here and not the other way round.
The European Court of Auditors makes us currently most concern.
Finally, the budget of the European Ombudsman to deal with.
On the contrary, we believe that, particularly in relation to the candidate countries should be accelerated research.
We also propose that Parliament will continue to be informed on a regular basis.
And if a legislative conciliation social affairs, culture or the environment takes place, the Commissioner will prove me right, we and the Commissioner for the budget, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets, together to pray that no financial inconsistency committed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome.
On the contrary, it has already first reading the budget approved it in 2001 seem justified without off tactical considerations, the aim of proper management of the Community institutions must continue to strive for all, would have been detrimental.
Before you decide on the draft budget for 2001, I should like to highlight a number of objectives, the agreement between the Council and Parliament, and the agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.
In the field of structural policy, we are in a similar situation.
Even the conciliation procedure in the summer, Mr Colom i Naval pointed out, had a good result of future improved information ausgabewirksamen legal bases are made available to the European Parliament.
I would remind you that last year, agreed financial plan for the Balkans only 1.85 billion for the entire period until 2006.
I would ask you - the Commission leaves its proposal on the table, this proposal to look calmly and as an opportunity to consider.
The material was both for the programming of the budget for 2001 and the discharge for 1999 appears to be very useful.
So I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets for the work of this body I respect, and I very much the work of the rapporteur and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets worthy, I shall, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy cannot fail to mention two amendments which the committee has presented again in plenary and its importance in spite of smaller amounts are not entirely irrelevant.
With these measures, we want judicial control again fully functional confidence in the EU's legal certainty again, and the European Union as a community of law strengthened.
The Commission has made immediate deletion of this initiative was a clear disregard of the political will of Lisbon and the priority of this House.
This decision was very strange and left many of us back to the impression that this important programme simply batted between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission had become.
My third point is that the European agricultural policy as it stands in the preliminary draft budget.
If the employment is a political priority for the Union, fishing as a further sector are not left behind.
I am particularly pleased that the funding for the final decision on the end of Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes could be secured.
The delays in our Mittelmeerhilfe, for example, amount to the budgets over several years.
Mr President, in recent years, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on whose behalf this afternoon Mrs Iivari referred.
However, I would like the honourable Members this afternoon say that we should not lose sight of the EU is only 1% of GDP used and a lot of paragraphs administered in the Member States.
I should now like to turn to the overall strategy.
In this regard, I would strategy where my group, because the guiding principle of our convictions, the desire for European citizens to guarantee a favourable cost-benefit as possible.
On the contrary, we must move towards a Parliament that is transparent, efficient and effective democratic control of the European institutions occurs.
Then we have to give some thought to how we can solve this problem.
We want to push ahead with democratic processes and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional areas of foreign policy, we are now before us.
The main problem in the new draft budget for external measures.
Thrifty economies must, of course, we support and we should not play fast and loose borders.
This is an extraordinary initiative, particularly in the first reading and it is a thankless initiative, because in the current circumstances, no majority.
Nevertheless, raises the size of the budgetary foresight in Kosovo some problems.
The budgetary policy, we need to citizens' confidence in the European policy Won.
All measures to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises are therefore to be supported.
The scope of the implementation of the budget
Behält this strategic line than approach to the budgets for this and for the coming years, Parliament takes its place in the budgetary procedure fully.
The transfer of EUR 175 million around EUR 25 million to provide more than we expected.
On the subject of MEDA, the Council stated that commitments are not the problem, because eight years have been accumulated delays in payments.
I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we in the European Council in Biarritz entered into.
My answer is quite simple.
assassinated Zapata was the last of the murdered 25 Member defenders of human rights, and recently published the Colombian press' plan EUR 100 'the paramilitary groups, EUR 100 defenders of human rights should be murdered.
The current position of the Council, I am rather happier than in July, the European Union, as we in many situations have seen always internationally as a last enter into phenomenon and their voice heard.
My question is, Mr President, and I will end here, if there are no opportunity to exert greater pressure, as the President has been proposed in its information, and whether the aid we want to provide assistance from the United States is quite different, not Fumigation plantations, but the replanting of other cultures and not military, but is committed to the social aspects.
I and other Members' questions relating in particular to the situation in Colombia.
As they relate to the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 dealt with together.
Subject: taxation of financial transactions call for a tax on speculative capital in the last few months is becoming increasingly ground as many ATTAC-Ausschüsse (Association pour Amanif Taxation sur les Transactions financières et pour l 'Aide aux Citoyens) in France and Europe and used in the French National Assembly and in the Senate amendments.
Furthermore, we must also answer the question of what impact the volatility of exchange markets, especially in a rate of 0.1 per mille, while Speculators devaluation of the order of 20 to 50% can be expected.
In paragraph 26 also calls on the establishment of an international Schiedsorganisation cancellation of the debts of the countries of the South.
Furthermore, Jahresmaßstab with the euro's case, whether it be regretted or welcomed.
The which Danielle Auroi earlier in relation to the countries of the South has said, I would like to add that the estimates of specialists contain interesting figures, such as a tax on the nature of the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 billion dollars would yield and, according to the calculations of the UNDP USD 40 billion per year would be sufficient to a minimum standard of living for the hundreds of millions of people in third world countries all lacking.
In the last few months, the disease in various parts of France has occurred.
As the representative of the French Presidency is here, I would like to know whether the slaughter of cattle from the EU budget or the national budget is being paid and whether your opinion is appropriate to pay from the EU budget.
I would like to ask you for your consent, that it can now be answered.
The margin for manoeuvre of the government concerned is limited by international law.
I understand, as the Commission in February comment on what it needs, and the Council in July.
If the European Union in the name of subsidiarity such action shows excuses in reality it exercise, as in the last few weeks, both in northern Italy and Spain did.
How can I, as a Member of the European Parliament, this majority keen to allow 11.5 billion pounds of British taxpayers, our current country, be spent if the public at large is not altogether?
With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council could agreement to be found in the second reading, in order to complete the budget.
If someone must be convinced that it is looking for evidence.
Mr Colom i Naval, responsible for buildings, Vice-President of the Commission has presented this strategy.
As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned, this year's draft budget contains many political messages. remaking agricultural policy, new structural programmes, safeguarding and improving the implementation of structural policy, implementing the decisions of Lisbon to create a stronger and competitive EU and to combat social exclusion.
NATO's war has destroyed too much and leave great suffering.
Despite the agreements reached, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to this objective within the framework of the existing budgetary constraints to achieve without the budget for sustainable agriculture in the present Member States is essential to undermine.
I have to give them clear answer: Koštunica must get its opportunity and I hope in the next few weeks or months to ensure an amnesty, but now I am willing to admit that, at political level, and with regard to the budget for the introduction of these two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions.
The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: people have enough, at long last, the dictator Milosevic and have confidence in Professor Koštunica.
I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will soon be released.
If we do not do so, we will inevitably lead to a 'financial perspective "amount of redistribution and cuts both in the general social and environmental expenditure and cooperation.
This initiatives to resolve the major social problems, such as unemployment, asked.
Of course, I am stufe something as enormously important, namely that we have started to category 4 have started, but I would like to make is not entirely clear whether there is a solution has been found, not because the Council is by no means working adequately prepared.
In any budgetary work, it is important to set priorities.
It is in view of the expiry of the Treaty in the near future is not very serious, but it would be a serious matter if the European Coal and Steel Community legislative framework following the possibility would be to go forward with such practices.
This leads to my third point, which is now before us.
The new financial agreement cannot be put in place which mistrust towards the politicians in the EU is growing, as I know.
Let us give credit where it is due.
The dialogue all the institutions concerned has enabled an unprecedented cooperation, which I sincerely hope will allow the first reading to reach an agreement.
We in the European values are Eurosceptic country, another argument in favour of the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, the people of modern society is very important.
I have noticed that in my own country, an amendment of the law on personal data is to be implemented, the influence of Members accounted for by the decisions of the Commission.
In many other issues too, we see problems to us, and we will have to await the verdict of the practice of sure.
(FR) The Commission and would first of all like to refer to the commitment that we all have to citizens, the protection of processed by the institutions to ensure personal data.
With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation solely on the activities under the first pillar is limited.
In accordance with the political agreement that the Commission, with the Council and the rapporteur, in order to be adopted at first reading, so any further amendment from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted Paciotti report reject, not to mention Amendment No 69 on the correction of Amendment No 41.
It is therefore essential that the staff of the interservice group within the General Secretariat of the Commission will be increased immediately, so that all the proposals legislation in general significance for their examination by the Commission on the basis of Article 299(2) attached a thorough impact analysis.
From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I want to stress that we really can only be treated equally, which is the same.
Given the importance of the fisheries sector for the outermost regions saddens me greatly.
Since under the presidency of Mr Delors an inter-service group for the outermost regions was set up, we have a long and fruitful way, and I must run this group has deep thanks to the outermost regions express living Europeans.
For example, already contained in the Treaty of Rome reference to the French overseas departments; it took until 1989 and to the POSEI-Programmen programmes to solve the specific remoteness and insularity problems due to the European Union finally realized that the immutable nature and combined performance of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions special treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community is justified.
I have no doubt that the proposals which the Commission will submit to the Council, characterised by these features.
This question is all the more relevant ever approaches the eastward enlargement of the EU.
This right of differentiation is nothing more than a result of equality that is to be treated differently, which is different.
It is a document that my team and my full of ideas and proposals look at the heart of the issues and nevertheless any of the issues to be passed in the outermost regions concern.
In your report, Mrs Sudre rightly stresses the need for a sustainable action.
The revival of economic diversification, we have a number of essential areas of progress.
What matters now is that a large number of projects within the framework of the DOCUP proposed alongside this activity on the ground, we must make the specific needs of the special access to all these outermost regions comprehensive analysis.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I will, of course, the President informed of your reference.
I am worried about the fact that many equipment from one country to another and the decisions of the House could be called into question, because the necessary provisions for such a case lacking.
Both these authority and put forward legislative proposals designed to ensure food safety, the support of this Parliament received, Commissioner.
The main focus of its activities of scientific advice, because the debate on food safety alike must be conducted on an objective basis.
Mr President, I would not like to miss this opportunity to the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take on board the opinions of the other committees, my thanks.
If we are faced with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied.
What is still controversial issue is to what extent we in the scope of this authority issues such as food and advice and support for the authorities to implement the management include, we believe that this agency for food standards in all matters of food safety, at the very least, should be given the opportunity to make a statement and to offer its support.
Of key importance is the preservation of the rich traditions.
Such recognition will not be legislation, not by legislation, but integrity of scientific excellence, independence, accountability, transparency and clarity.
Good scientific knowledge are certainly essential if the risks associated with the food chain, from farm to table, evaluate them better.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the establishment of a European food safety agency, as our rapporteur mention general support.
If WHO-Programm remains the necessary resources and receive the necessary support, we do not need additional agency which applies in particular to an agency with the 15 Member States of the European Union limited scope.
Food safety is the fundamental precondition for consumers, because consumers want healthy food, and we must ensure.
If we do not get a new framework directive, we will have a great deal in the area of food safety just smile.
Therefore changes are needed in the Treaty, so that the Commission’s sanctions in the food sector in the hands, as these are already in place in the field of competition.
I support all the partners involved, whether political, administrative or other Trägerschaften strategy 'food for all' work.
I agree with this statement, not because a person just more than just a body.
The authority must head the real coordination of the network of national agencies, which a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of individual regions in the implementation and the need to coordinate.
Their Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 should therefore certainly combined.
The reform of food legislation in the European Union should take place at European Union level.
In his report is not so much proposed amendments, but rather priorities.
In the report we have clearly formulated this request, which I very much welcome.
The creation of a European Food Safety Authority is extremely welcome.
It is in the interests of all European citizens hope that these criteria are complied with.
I believe that must be laid down specific periods within which the Commission certainly justified concern informed.
The EU must take their citizens in the food sector possible guarantee high standards.
The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Authority.
I am concerned that Europe is once again run the risk of making a bloated bureaucracy, which is unable to act.
The more new levels of bureaucracy, and we must provide more money we spend fewer can be thus bring about.
Please stop parallel and similar work in various institutions.
However, we must avoid in the shadow of the discussion on the White Paper public fears about a bureaucratic Europe, the quality of the products influence and effectively against damaging to health deception and mislead consumers to proceed strengthened.
As you know, enjoying the strategy for food safety in the Commission's top priority.
The Commission will adopt a proposal for a regulation, which is the framework for the future of health protection measures falls form in the food sector and the general principles and objectives of food law.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
However, our report, I consider that the Commission's proposal as a positive and it must be said that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and our Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation have intensive work it possible, in particular on certain points, continue to improve.
As has already been our colleague, Mrs Bonino clearly and explicitly mentioned in the proposal for a regulation from the Commission is a further step forward.
We believe that the Commission's proposal for a regulation too vague.
It is essential that the equipment of mines in accordance with reasonable organised and that we are funding for research, detention and Räumungsarbeiten instruments on the ground are used in a simple way so that they just bring aid to the developing countries.
In the past eight years we have more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget to combat landmines.
We cannot, however, people for their incompetent Government’s punished.
As I have already said, I think it would well intentioned, but wrong and counterproductive to join the Ottawa Convention on the firm and immediate condition to be met support for mine action by the European Union.
I reject Amendment No 19.
Secondly, the international community must coordination at global level and in particular to improve in the affected countries.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with the comments made by Mr Van Orden, and also proud of the role of the European Union.
We recall the Soviet Union Spielzeugbomben in Afghanistan.
Mr President, I should like to express my thanks for a good report.
Mr President, the Cambodians mines described as Perpetual Sentries.
With regard to uniform forces people have a legitimate suspicion long years of war was built.
Mr President, I am pleased that we finally have a European legislation in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that this is a good report by Mrs Bonino is submitted on this regulation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with a very sad matter.
It is no coincidence that the mines are mainly in crisis regions, in areas where different initiatives could be taken to deal with this crisis.
In two kilometres away the Bosnian village is pointing in 1999 Shield Minengefahr area out, but that does not prevent a small boy play there.
It is a tragedy if the civilian population in the failure of its leaders must suffer.
Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, you on behalf of our institution, your country special relations within the framework of our common endeavour to build an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean coastal states to welcome.
All mines are deposits.
Mr President, I agree with most of what I am my fellow Members have said, I will not repeat them.
Their conception of open cooperation is synonymous with a reversion to the Commission officials dominated institutional system.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, because decisions are to be taken as close to those affected as possible.
However, the main amendments from the Group of the European People 's Party has just a considerable majority achieved, I voted in favour of the report.
Mr President, I abstained on the results of the informal European Council Biarritz, for two reasons abstain: firstly, that, as I had the opportunity, in particular paragraphs 2 and 5 separate vote and thus my opposition to both expression.
In other words, at the table of the common European House’s some would dine à la carte, while others must Einheitsmenü content.
And the democratic control must not cease, but at the same time consider the European Union, the main problem is not the list of these rights or its inclusion in the Treaties.
The means of referendums and amendments to this report have already been mentioned.
In the elections to the European Parliament in 1999, the turnout was only 40% if the countries Wahlpflicht and those who at the same time as the European elections carried out national elections, abrechnet.
To the desired objective of a European constitution, to ensure that it is not advisable to impose strict Rechtsfiguren and methods, the disastrous failure to meet the desired objective would be.
A genuine social constitution should the main achievements in favour of the labour market, women, immigrants and the citizens upwards to adapt.
. - (PT) I did not vote for the report, although I do it a laudable strengthening, lighting and deepening of the European Union and the simplification of the texts necessary for its proximity to the people, not oppose.
the distribution of powers
In my opinion, it is essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the EU after the Convention of the Council of Europe means.
The report by Mr Gil-Robles, however, I have to help, because it contains the proposal that some Member States of the European Union on certain issues, sectors and areas coordinate joint action.
If ever more important issues by qualified majority voting, violates basic democratic standards.
Today, it is trying to making strengthened cooperation more flexible to obstruct and subject to here.
This report is intended to clarify the relevant position of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).
We are generally so-called flexible cooperation favour.
The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the agreement on her contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the issue of closer cooperation, even if they do not agree with all the details.
The island regions must be as an active feel part of the European Union, which, I hope, a paradise for tourists and turn for the local population.
In the Middle Ages were those regions and their populations, not to Europe, and now they are not as a truly European.
In fact, the specific features of these regions, in general, its islands and their distance from mainland Europe, but also from their chronic dependence on a few products or a single product derived need to overcome these obstacles, specific measures to be taken.
Mr President, I am sorry, but the Bureau and the interpreters so as to visit my hearing last explanation of vote, and I would like in particular to my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, in my case, the Italian woman Ornella Buson show.
These texts clear that this agency to the restriction or paralysis of the national Schutzbefugnisse aimed at the service of the Kommissionsziele.
This does not mean, however, that the Commission and Parliament do not, however, this institution as a "European authority ', although they called for behind the philosophy runs completely counter.
That is not exactly what the Bowis report proposes, we feel, food safety will be largely seen as another pretext, through its well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission at the expense of national institutions and the security of our citizens would continue.
That is why I think it is appropriate to this statement on behalf of our European Parliament, which is always respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all religious communities have happened to condemn these appalling acts.
Madam President, I understand the disturbance of the rapporteur, but with the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is not only voted on money, but it will also be voting on a particular direction.
I would also ask you to support this line A-206 acquisition of property adjustment, which amendments are adopted, so that we have our own limit of 20% of total administrative expenditure does not exceed.
Before the vote on amendment 929
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Report (A5-0276/2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea (ICES zone VIII (a) [COM(2000) 0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
By export subsidies in the EU Lebensmittelüberschuss at dumping prices brought on the world market, which in turn would lead to serious competitive disadvantages, for example the food industry will result in many developing countries.
In order to provide adequate financial resources for additional aid release in the Balkans, the Member States must reallocate resources available budget.
Nevertheless, Parliament has managed to impose a number of important tasks - not least in view of the increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, many important environmental and gender equality, etc. We attacks against the rights of the LIFE programme and the European Women's lobby voted.
With regard to the reimbursement of travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament, we still believe that only actual business travel costs should be paid.
I understand - and I hope that the Commission will be constructive appropriate solutions, we three years between 2002 and 2005, with a transitional period will be filled.
In order to all the national parliaments to miss a genuine quiet, the European Commission in the context of its regulatory and Liberalisierungswut a proposal for an immediate binding regulation rather than a directive presented a real Hauruckverfahren by Parliament and the Council of Ministers whipped already on 31 December of this year to enter into force.
We therefore support the Commission 's reform path and reject the other preferential treatment in this sector.
This came over-dependence on borrowing.
Nicholson report (A-0276/2000)
The misappropriation of funds for military targets must be avoided.
We have always believed that the cost of reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases with the actual perpetrators, be borne by the big and the burden of its super profits must go.
Report Moreira Da Silva (A5-0271/2000)
This money should be used by spending on research in all 15 Member States of the European Union, harmonised and coordinated.
In order to ensure prevention, clarity’s to give these substances.
That concludes the vote.
It is the place of the already used everywhere eminence, defend national.
The zahlungsbilanzstatistische lost as a result of this amendment is minimal.
You have to think of them mainly small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned.
We urge for years to harmonise the efforts.
I believe that this report is of crucial importance, and indeed the citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to integrate the acceptance of economic and monetary union will increase.
In the case of free movement of capital with the single currency must not barriers or greater differences.
I nevertheless take the European Parliament and the Commission a great deal of attention.
I support the twin-track approach of the rapporteur, hesitant banks will lead to move.
We cannot banks decommissioning force business, but we as politicians the amendment by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled support what the end of next year measures and best adequate standards in the euro coins and seem to be demanded.
The amendment by Mrs Peijs and I aims towards the banks together around the table, not to dictate to, but because we are just the political side pressure can no longer raise.
If the implementation of cross-border transfers is still just as expensive as it is today, the credibility of the new Münzen- and Banknotensystems called into question.
We believe that it is a form of collecting statistical data on the body of internal European Union payments is a relic of the past, integrated space is no longer justified and the proper functioning of the internal market affected.
However, the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee of this House belonging for longer than I understand, I have the impression that the process with the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and the European Parliament for the fourth time you’ in this category is one of them.
I thank you in advance for supporting my report.
But if we withdraw at European level, we must restore the regions more opportunities.
The SMEs are first and foremost in the creation of jobs, both qualitative and quantitative terms and play in this way a key factor in social cohesion and regional planning.
By carefully study the proposals and the vote with many interested parties help clearer wording of the programme and its optimum preparations carried out.
Thirdly, we need a European added value endeavour.
Because of all this, followed by small and medium-sized enterprises can only be a good thing if unemployment is low and if public finances in all areas free of debt and sufficient resources for this Investitionshaushalt cease.
Businesses need clarity.
In particular, when a one-man operation or operating under 250 employees project, not only Sicherstellungen land 120% -Sicherung possible, but it should also be possible, with a good idea to be financed.
The nation states and regional or local authorities already act as a huge Finanzpumpen there taxpayers' money, the majority of the population, including the poorest eingetriebenen amounts of big business and thus in the pockets of their owners and shareholders to pump.
It is the small and medium-sized business thousands of fragile plant shows large companies as a seed for human and artistic serve ideas.
I would like the Commissioner in connection with all of the measures proposed in this primarily concerned, easier and quicker access to information and assistance is being created, so that those who these companies are able to use this information effectively.
They all the multiannual programme have their place.
Finally, I welcome the idea that we meet year’s assessment of the implementation of the programme to be drawn.
The recent actions against the Greek minority Himare require more action to democratisation, strengthening the institutions and the protection of human rights in Albania.
A considerable number of Albanians leave their homes due to the insecurity in their own country, because of the social problems due to the prämodernen company and family structures.
We need Albania’s specifically tailored preventive measures to help in the construction or reconstruction of the country constitute a dignified standard of life in the region.
In this way, the documents of a body to another crushed, and the Commission is refusing, for example, the report including produced by the Albanian Customs Assistance Mission (CAM published.
Let us face the truth.
Mrs Karamanou, my congratulations on the broad and comprehensive tour ïhorizon your report.
This is a very important issue for historical, social, political and economic circumstances results.
The real number of deaths, we will never know.
Common business to create a peaceful links.
I am, however, completely unacceptable find in this report and what I would like to mention open cause and effect, illegal immigration with the visa procedure weighted and therefore be confused Migrationsmöglichkeit I reversed.
The Treaty of Amsterdam secondary major institutional reform had consequences for the treatment of problems of refugee and immigration policy.
Finally, the action plan must and its implementation should be considered regionally.
But of course off this request ourselves economically dealing with European regulations.
The strength of Community action at the moment should be highlighted.
Moreover, I would call for changes to existing legislation of the EC codified proposals in the amendments to the existing directives or regulations are included.
The principle of subsidiarity said, in both directions: decisions at the lowest level to make, but I understand that the lowest possible level, sometimes a very high level when it comes to universal values, the loss is threatened if they did not would be equally protected.
The report is a prime example of pregnant, clear and I hope colleagues will seriously note.
The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has met its members are not enthusiastic.
And this is something that I am report SLIM-Vorhaben entered into, as Community legislation Mr Medina read out one of the articles of the Treaty a test are experts even difficult to understand.
It is therefore solve some aspects of the report I have little enthusiasm, because I would have liked to have more communitarized 'report wanted in relation to the internal market, and it is quite obvious that the report does not just driven.
For the European institutions, it is important that we have a specific commitment, the quality of legislation, particularly with a view to subsidiarity, to improve.
The debate is closed.
The persistence of this condition could attitudes and the acceptance of citizens with regard to the euro will have an adverse effect on.
Mr President, we have very carefully in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Karamanou report prepared.
However, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to our oral question and to take advantage of this debate to both sides, because our resolution is addressed to both sides, some thoughts, with great caution.
This is the demand of the peoples of the Union that we represent here.
A great deal of water, the Rhine has gone down, yet the agreement expired, and not replaced.
My reasons for the Commissioner, but do not understand the Director-General.
We could say that we are 11 months after the closure of our vessels to continue to pay the previous agreement and the previous earlier.
Mr President, similar debate we had a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations at all to be included in the first place, shows how difficult it is to fish stocks in our extensive EU fleets.
In the second agreement was the position clear.
However, we must understand that everything is finally fish stocks.
That is why I am particularly keen to clarify that the PPE-DE Group will not only be distinguished itself to support the fisheries agreements to defend and promote, but also to extend its firm support.
Thirdly, the exploitation of the Sahara Fanggrundes since the suspension of the agreement by the Community fleet and other continues to control either by the Commission or the Member States: It talks with a great fleet from the Netherlands.
I understand that, because the fisheries income and created jobs, measured in terms of European conditions poor region.
Another point I should like to stress that the end of the temporary aid for fishermen and vessel owners at the end of this month, as compensation for this one-year Standstill served. This is unacceptable because everyone wants to work rather than referring aid.
As Andalusian Members of Parliament, am a year ago, the corridors in the offices in the Committee on Fisheries and the discussions with the Commissioner to negotiate and to propose initiatives, so that the special nature of the Andalusian fleet into account in Morocco carries the extractive.
Spain has the difficult neighborhood history constantly between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco in an excellent way developed positively.
As a Spanish and Andalusian MEP, I call upon the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to preserve and protect their jobs for nearly a year at risk and we Parliament must protect.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Almost 12-year history is full of Kanzleitrost tactics, hopes that personal distress placebos concerned the defence of tough old rights to citizens simply looking as their right.
As you know, the matter is extremely complex and around 700 workers to 25 Italian universities.
If the Italian legal systems reformed and changed, as the Hochschulpersonal the case, the Commission does not, in our view, intervene as long as all European citizens equal access to all grades at its disposal.
The injustice is that two people do the same work, work hand in hand, but uniformly remunerated and different working conditions.
Worst, I think that, if we have to draw attention to the fact that a judgment to advantage may only a few reassuring words and for their further life is not, in fact, is important.
I expect an answer from the Commission to the point that it is in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the case of Allué against Article 48(2) of the EEC Treaty conflict when the legislation of Member States, the duration of contracts Fremdsprachenassistenten each is limited to one year, with the possibility of renewal, while in relation to other teachers such a restriction does not.
Well, I think that affect these matters to the heart of European law related fundamental principles of freedom, freedom of movement and of these principles, there must be no exceptions.
We, as today's debate has shown that a great many constraints, a great many obstacles to this single market, not only in this case.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In a message of condolence to the Austrian Federal President Klestil and Mr Schüssel, I am speaking on behalf of our House and members of the Austrian people at this difficult moment express our condolences.
Are there any comments?
I support the proposal made by Mr Ceyhun and would be very grateful if the Council could say whether it intends, in fact, produce a new proposal on this matter.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Our group considers this event so important that we believe that it is urgent procedure would not be treated properly.
Mr Barón Crespo, I have the impression that you, if I have understood you correctly, endorse this explanatory statement.
Madam President, some time ago we debated in this House on the sanctions against Iraq.
It is essential that we implement the changes that have been announced by the British authorities to carry out a debate on this matter, and the Commission must clearly the legal provisions comment in this matter.
(A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the conclusion of an agreement on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of the proceeds of crime and financial crime (10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815(CNS)).
The statements of intent must be followed by practical action, so that the proceeds of crime identified, frozen, seized and confiscated.
The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice should not be in the hands of a specialised body under the sole control of national governments remain.
On the other hand, it is limited to Article 8 of the draft convention, the reasons for the refusal of mutual assistance in legal matters, ersuchter Member State can refer to the basic interests.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and to point out that the efforts to combat financial crime support, but also care.
If terrorists and arms trafficking and drug traffickers money laundering, which must of course be detected, pursued and punished.
Our task is the proceeds from organised crime track to establish freeze to seize and confiscated.
In order to these points in the amendments, and the debate in committee to judge, I am very confident that Parliament agrees.
It seems to me that this list of initiatives forward in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provided protection may destroy.
In fact, is, however, not so easy.
Finally, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment on the activities of the lawyers we Mrs Roure reached.
The second measure, the second instrument harmonisation.
This is a Portuguese initiative, already several previous speakers have praised.
And was the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council on 17 October of this year.
The best way to strengthen parliamentary and judicial control of Europol is the full involvement of the EUROPOL-Übereinkommens the legal framework of the European Union.
One step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has long been seeking to create a preliminary point on judicial cooperation.
It is here that the purpose of guarantees, the development of the issue of freedom.
And the European Parliament is the supranational Community body to establish these relations. my speech, I should like to ask you the foundations of this relationship and to acknowledge our rapporteur to give your approval.
Only when clarity about the institutional model and the rules for future European judicial area, the citizens and the European Parliament on the proposed by the Council express individual measures.
That is why Eurojust is a logical part of the efforts to citizens the fight against serious organised crime an area of freedom, security and justice and a high level of safety to offer.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that Mrs Gebhardt only on her excellent report on the implementation of a Council decision taken in Tampere presents.
Is there, however, such as Eurojust coordination at the level of national public prosecutors and judges to all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur, is the extension of the concept: it is not just cooperation in purely cross-border crime, but cooperation to combat crime.
We are already from 1 January 2001 have an opportunity to make a preliminary to engage judicial cooperation, but the Commission intends to discuss the appearance of the final EUROJUST-Stelle Upswing.
everyone’s honest position, I believe, without, however, rigid Frontstellungen lapse.
The problems associated with the expenditure for the Committee on Fisheries is not too alarming, other areas more interest.
It is really unacceptable that we have no clear objectives and the results cannot be measured. in any other body.
Secondly, the question of hierarchy of authorising it has come unacceptable overlap, Commissioner.
I would therefore like to make it clear that the programme on some issues played a positive role.
It is clear that this work in consortiums do not automatically lead to division on the joint financial responsibility will lead. is complex.
We have therefore supported the fact that recovering 3.4 million, and we can say that more than 90% succeeded.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after neunmonatiger work and a long time struggle for a consensus is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the proposal.
I hope that this Parliament, even if it is now only say 'yes' to this Charter of Fundamental Rights, in the next few weeks has no doubt about the fact that the Council, the legally binding nature of this Charter demands and that this Charter people access to the European Court of Justice must be open.
This position is correct, as you know, the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz and we agree that the Charter and unanimously approved unreservedly I so it is in the name of the Council just ask to join this position and I will give you a few reasons explain.
Above all, however, the Charter is I believe its basic weight, as I would like to say, get epochal importance.
The European Trade Union Confederation has, for its part, as he calls it - presence of complained gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage.
Quite apart from several people and especially some Members of the European Parliament to propose an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which is already contains a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Our group agrees with the exception of the United Kingdom delegation of the Charter unanimously.
We are, of course, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, together with unanimously that the Charter of Fundamental Rights as soon as possible in the Treaties, in order to direct the force of law developed for the people of the European Union.
You have shown that European issues in a new and exemplary way approaching, as a result of their democratically open and transparent operation and the possibility of participation in the form of the Intergovernmental Conference will consider.
The right to health, social protection, housing and minimum wage a lack or refer in the area of solidarity.
Fourthly, the Charter, and this is particularly important for me - the indivisibility of human and civil rights and political and social fundamental rights.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union to keep bedeutungsleere produce texts and declarations of intent.
The representative of the Court of Justice has already indicated that the inspiration of the Charter and the representative of the Commission in the Convention attaches in Turin document legal significance.
In the time of the market so that maybe the hour of the Europe of rights have come. concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.
The Charter is drafted as a text which are legally binding.
I am proud to say that a representative of my Group in my own country, Mr Gunnar Jansson a very important role in the drafting of this Charter has played.
As I said last night, and I do so again in this respect across the European Union many shortcomings as we will succeed in our efforts to judicial and police cooperation are not always specific effects must be eliminated in the fight against crime and to prevent innocent victims passive.
Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same uncertainty as the work of the body.
The Italian Constitution provides, for example, the limit of morality and the European Convention on Human Rights, the limit of the rights of others or public order.
Mr President, today's vote at 12 noon, we will support a process that began in 1984, when this Parliament's draft adopted by the Treaty on European Union, which already requested a statement of rights and the 1989 with the resolution continued De Gucht.
The Charter will have consequences if it is included in the Treaty or not.
This is to be welcomed, and not, as Mr Bonde seems to think that fear.
Obviously, the neigende century, with all its fight for the liberation of disadvantaged social classes, passed useless and has taught us nothing.
The Charter fills a gap in EU law and reinforces the protection of individuals with regard to the European police to the authorities to combat fraud, and the competition authorities.
However, the rejection of the shortcomings of the Charter is justified, I do not understand.
Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton left off.
Allow me to make a third comment on the rights of third-country nationals.
The Council of Europe 's Court of Human Rights is also extensive experience such forms of control collected on which we can build.
In view of the text of the Charter we are approving today, as I hope, with a large majority, it is obvious that we in our Charter and more zeitgemäßeren protection of fundamental rights will achieve it as accession to the European Convention on Human Rights had provided.
That is why we need to move forward.
I believe that we should pursue this objective if we have to make the necessary support to the Charter by the citizens of Europe want.
Following its adoption by this Parliament the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Analyseschema I serve to this report and, as far as my personal intellectual potential and I have available human resources it I should like rights and countries broken down analysis of compliance with the Charter in the fifteen Member States of the European Union make.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to begin by thanking the words of President Mr Moscovici and endorse the essential contribution of the Members of the European Parliament to debate worthy of the name in the Convention and in particular the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo it in the Convention's Praesidium played in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I would just like to mention some of the striking points in this debate.
The Convention Fundamental Rights from the various instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
As things stand at present, this Parliament has the Turkish people to make it clear that currently three conditions for its accession.
Such conditions would also not by Parliament’s decision can be made.
That is why I have the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to note the great interest.
I am pleased to say that the Turkish Government has, in the meantime, this partnership as a basis for further cooperation has recognised, so that we can have a legitimate hope to achieve precisely what we wanted to achieve our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform... and it in relation to the objective of membership of the European Union in this sphere.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is most important that after Helsinki in Turkey, the Turkish public debate on the conditions of Turkey joining the EU, given rise to debate the country’s reformers and calls for support.
This text you opinion.
It is now a question of a necessary boost for future accession.
I would nonetheless - I do not know what the outcome of tomorrow's vote will, urge Turkey to take this issue seriously.
The European Parliament is actively involved in the reception and care of relations with political parties, NGOs and the press use and trying to improve their difficult and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.
Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, very realistically and responsibly.
On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March, you have the problem of the Kurdish people, today at least named.
It shows, at the same time extremely naive and great arrogance to accept that Europeans Turkey - and I quote - 'radical change in their traditions and their attitude may move ".
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report met me with great concern.
Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233(AVC))
In any case, we must in the next occasions when we discuss the power of computer systems to realise that a thorough and therefore more people legally certain control is required.
Recommendation Duff/Voggenhuber report (A5-0325/2000)
The following points, we wish to highlight:
The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments, peoples and cultures which are close.
1, which provides for 'collective expulsions are not allowed' not laid down that the ban in time of war or in cases of serious disruption of public order can be suspended. Article 52 section.
We are following a brief explanation on these three reasons, in that order.
The right of any government to the arbitrary behaviour of their own constitution is characteristic of a tyranny.
But today, we have, as I would like to repeat that good reason to be proud that this important step for Europe to be met.
A society which only knows rights but no duties selfish society.
And this is something that we must fight primarily addressed to ensure that the fundamental rights proclaimed specified on political decisions.
The process of the Convention is very interesting and efficient for the drawing up of a basic requires a broad consensus, but in no way justify the European Parliament as a representation of the people of Europe the opportunity to amend the text and complement to escape.
This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must take a strategy to its updating and propose enrichment.
That is why the Council meeting in Nice will not be adopted and proclaimed, but the summit should push for a European debate on the Charter.
Fortunately the national governments tend mentality to follow the path of reason, a charter with a purely political and not to adopt binding scope.
The Cologne Summit as a 'body', this even proclaimed 'convention', a term that unfortunate way 1793, and another Convention excesses of the French Revolution in the form of terrorism has in mind.
The procedure applied, made exclusion and lack of clarity with regard to the nature of the text, on the other hand, raise clearly the new totalitarian approaches already lies at the very heart of the European integration process are to be found.
Fortunately, the European Parliament in this area to the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam is only a consultative role, but it will find ways to use those decisions right delayed.
The views of the way but divergence.
This was a century ago, and after it somewhat pushed into the background, it is now once again fully brought to the fore.
What we do not want, however, is the ability to allow criminals, the door to the single market.
We also advocate the establishment of a future Kooperationsstelle to support the fight against organised crime and money-laundering as well as the various measures proposed in order to achieve these objectives.
In other words, there will be a preliminary point of judicial cooperation set up ever representatives of the public prosecutor, judge or prosecuting police powers of our 15 Member States make up.
Mr President, speaking as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Turkey I deal intensively with the Turkish accession perspective.
Turkey's conduct in Cyprus is unacceptable.
However, we support the rapporteur's critical comment about the lack of an effective evaluation of the loans granted by the EIB and the lack of transparency and appropriate public supervision of the Bank's activities.
Despite its diversity and Turkey is an integral part of the European reality.
The accession of Turkey to the European Union is becoming a question which is now increasingly topical one.
Mr Morillon said that Turkey should effort, not the European Union, as an exclusive Christian club, to which Turkey wants to exclude.
Turkey is a real democratic state, if they are to live with their past have learned, as well as the democratic Germany, we have called for the same managed to live with its past.
Once the Government in Ankara has realised that the status quo for Europe and the rest of the world is unacceptable, great progress possible. The island’s could be reunited and comprehensive, fair, sustainable and international law appropriate solution.
Why because all these issues in the report by the European Commission is not mentioned?
In this balanced framework we must do our work to promote convergence between the Union and Turkey firmly, and will continue to do so.
If you the Armenian issue in connection with accession to the EU deal with, I would ask you to pay attention to what I am saying: the Armenian issue in connection with accession to the EU, the project which we have discussed today, not launch, the simple.
For this reason, we have worked hard to ensure that, after the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona Process concluded, so that we in Marseilles are in a position to establish the necessary guidelines.
But we have managed to maintain the dialogue and sensitive issues such as stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights.
Having said this, the Council has tried, especially since 1995 in the Mediterranean greater resources to the objectives of the partnership appropriate.
This is indeed a very important matter, and I should also like to say that as one who comes from Central Europe.
Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, whereby a show no Star as Hamlet-Aufführung without first destroying.
We combination of policies on internal market questions and consensus on the introduction of cumulation while closing Sub-regional free trade agreement between all partners and the adoption of harmonised protocol on cumulation.
We also have the intention of the Commission to the Barcelona process, to give fresh impetus to note with satisfaction.
I have highlighted these aspects, because the key to revitalise the process to find and also the political agenda must be supplemented by the Barcelona Process.
That is why our main task must guarantee the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that this cooperation is enforced and that the promised funds with the tell us - the European Union selfish generosity are used efficiently.
These are important and specific questions that I would like to ask, and I would like to thank Mr Brok, this debate immediately before the relevant meetings of the presidency and the Commission on these matters has made.
The world is now inexorable globalisation, contrary to what, in this scenario is an organisation in large, the vast field of international competition as the key players operating reactors are needed.
It is disappointing that the Mediterranean EUR 4.7 billion in the MEDA I programme, which expired in 1999, just over one quarter drawn.
Therefore, the Commission proposal on a new impetus is positive and we fully endorse the priorities that Mr Patten mentioned in his speeches and confirmed here this afternoon.
This is a warning to the European Union, a much more active role to play in the Mediterranean, our European continent historical and cultural enriched and strengthened.
What is more, at the same time as we in this House are sometimes very different views factual exchange, more and more Palestinians killed.
Reconstruction aid
If we in December but not to contribute to the implementation of this regulation, we are now dreschen empty straw.
We must not and do not want to focus the role they have played close, and I hope that the Member States do not.
The media in those region are often responsible for the tragedy, media are needed freely in our democracies rules operate.
It is a very happy man, I am also because the European Parliament, as I believe that persistent pressure has managed to a situation which is not exactly initially could be described as favourable to better address.
Once again, Unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings must really be avoided.
We must look, however, is not just focused on Kosovo.
The fact that some programmes of the so-called 'performance reserve' performance reserve 'status is regrettable.
In Feira it on the Stabilisation and Association Process participating countries status as potential candidates for entry granted.
I refer once again to the basic objectives of the CARDS programme: institutional reinforcement in terms of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction and regional cooperation.
It was right for the European Union to the seizure of power by President Kostunica has responded in a positive way.
A first meeting took place on 6 November.
What initiative in terms of the demand made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000 does the Presidency intend to take to play a more active role, so that the full implementation and restlose UN-Friedensplans guaranteed?
How can this revival, without the rule of the conflict be done?
I can only tell you that France and Germany - and I am not now speaking as President-in-Office of the Council, these issues in a bilateral summits mentioned Vittel last week and the creation of a working group on the solution adopted.
At the same time, the European Union these two countries will continue to extensive aid through its various programmes, especially TACIS.
The Presidency wishes to the honourable Member's question give some clarification.
I would like the accuracy add: concerns both texts, the criminal framework for fighting organised gangs to increase.
In the report which the Turkish Council of Ministers on 21 September and reform adopted the amendments section contains several projects, including measures to strengthen the effective equality between men and women in the field of sozialpädagogischen civil code; more in the fight against violence, better condemnation of this violence by setting up special Familienrichter and banning the possibility of Strafnachlasses crimes passionnelles reasons.
The Presidency has therefore no response on this matter.
Next week in France, at my invitation to a meeting of the European Conference, with the candidate countries.
Do you think that the model Austria, bilateral majority in the future will be an instrument of the European institutions is past decisions and a new institution or a new group set up to circumvent unanimity in the Council?
The Council has not dealt with the letter, but the Presidency has, of course, reply to Mr Cem. text of this response has been sent to all the Member States.
What is its view, moreover, the statement by Mr Cem, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, did not respond, in his opinion, the Cyprus question could further treatment of partnership between Turkey and the European Union are not taken into account?
It is important to know that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is far more than a simple agreement on fishing and that this agreement should not come, as he knows, a deterioration of relations between the European Union and Morocco into the House could.
That is why I must voice my scepticism, which is the result.
With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that, in order to strengthen cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of individual rights should be made possible.
The questions must be asked by other Members.
Moreover, the Commission has announced on 4 October 2000 adopted communication on the European Union's oil supply, the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy savings and submit the diversification of energy sources, which should help to energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport to strengthen it.
It is in this spirit that we have during the vote on the resolution on sanctions in the framework of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November call on the Cuban authorities say fully cooperate with the international human rights organisations.
It is therefore up to the ΝΑΤΟ arrangements, it deems necessary to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.
(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 and resumed at 9 p.m.)
If money, it is the person who privilege of money, the political objectives clearly defined, and the Commissioner has done repeatedly.
His visit signal and the policy that we are pursuing, give a perspective.
If we see in it a region in which political conflicts are possible, we are wrong.
And the second demand by the two rapporteurs and all of us must be supported the regular information and consultation of the European Parliament.
The Heads of State and Government also emphasized the Union's determination to this process by economic and technical aid to match.
It was Parliament that the Commission's proposal to set up a European Agency for Reconstruction has supported.
As the House will know, we believe that an appropriate explicit reference in the regulation is not necessary.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
For the Asia-Europe cooperation in 2000, the participants agreed an updated and extended under the working programme for the coming decade forms.
I believe that we in Europe have reminded us how important we have for Asia, and not only in terms of economic and trade. However, although on this point, it should be pointed out that Asia is the recovery of its economic situation, among other things, due to the fact that we have kept our word and our markets in the last two years Asian exports were open.
I think that was a very good political commitment, but we have given some problems.
As you know, the Commission is taking ASEM very seriously, and we support the Commission in this respect fully.
It is essential that the existing mechanisms for implementing Community legislation to improve, to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current slow rate.
That is why the creation of new regional organisations and promote start where we already have a presence in the Community, as in southern and western Pacific.
That is the precondition for a truly sustainable fishing.
I believe that the future of fishing in international waters dependent on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, are too limited. In order to the attitude of the UN, both in the Convention from 1982, as mentioned in New York, we must defend a very active presence in these organisations to benefit of responsible fishing at our disposal.
That is why I believe that the Commission should play a particularly important role. It fishermen’s call for cooperation and propose solutions that we can all agree.
In addition, the Commission has plenty of tasks in connection with negotiations to take in the context of regional fisheries organisations must be conducted.
Mr President, I have the same problem as Mr Nicholson, only a lot of acute.
So that is the solutions proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Sometimes we have even asked to what extent the cyclical crisis in sales themselves may be speculation of the business structures generated in this way, the monitoring of the sector according to their interests.
The additional EU-Beihilfe proposed in the Garot report, is, in my opinion, make sense at the time when Agenda 2000 and enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe, the reform of agricultural policy is on the agenda.
I think it is quite modest, the rapporteur hingelegt shows what administration, listening to a specific objective, which is clearly indicated.
On the one hand, there would be the largest producers or those related companies integrated means keeping and benefit systems, which they have already, individual savings of loans granted by financial institutions, compensation fund.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say straight away that I am in principle the Commission proposal to set up a compensation fund in the spirit of the Austrian agriculture is welcome.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
I understand that you want a market organisation for intensive animal husbandry and dismantling of the common agricultural policy, if bodenabhängig bodenabhängige production.
The common organisation of the market in pig meat, and we should not make the mistake of the current common organisation of the market in pig meat, in principle, working on.
The Commission is of the opinion that it is justified only the farmers who enter the compensation fund discipline subject, because they get in exchange for a certain amount of income support, while others do not join, they do not receive income support.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
It is based on VAT revenue make 36%, and the traditional own resources 15% of the total.
Another part of the reform, to a large extent highlighted by the Court of Auditors priority area, in line with the increased importance of Ergebnis- and Erfolgsmessung within a system of resource allocation under vorgegebener priorities and clearly defined, quantifiable objectives.
That is good, and I should like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors give warm thanks to you for your report on the reform of the Commission support.
I very much hope that this proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice is not simply buried or swept under the carpet, but it is seriously tackle.
The reality, as described in the annual report is rather sobering.
The number of similar mistakes high as such a guarantee would be accepted.
The amount of drops high-wage and 240 million set too low.
I would like to make the Court of Auditors' report also envisage a little more user-friendly, supplemented by clear recommendations, for example, one or two chapters per.
In 1995 Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities adopted.
The Commission and the Member States should it in that light and consider the results of the report as a means to improve the management of financial resources for the European Union to use.
I am aware that this report and the work of the European Parliament within the framework of the discharge procedure due to greater vigilance with regard to Community expenditure will help.
And now, Madam President, I would like to mention and wait for someone from the Council.
The Court of Auditors, as well as in recent years not specify that because the aforementioned mistake.
Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union before, and the Court of Auditors' report makes it clear that the applicant countries a great deal to be done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just made an agreement with the Court of Auditors, it was a question of whether we are already very secret Kämmerchen preliminary report- received, and we agreed that we really remain silent.
I would like to address the question of why the decision on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation is still awaiting.
Perhaps a little sense from the European Union, to help to resolve the problem and George Bush its rightful place in the history give Müllkorb.
It is not our job to find scapegoats, either in our institutions in our countries.
I am delighted that the Members of this House are of the opinion that the situation with regard to the presentation of the annual report in Parliament and in the Committee on Budgetary Control satisfactory than in previous years.
We will, however, have the opportunity to discuss all the issues.
However, from the point of view of the auditor is relevant that we should mention all the facts need to be mentioned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how do you have pointed out, the last part of the speech of the President of the Court of Auditors by a fatal virus affected in his contribution, and this House has crept in.
Some amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18 are linked issues, particularly affecting the United Kingdom, and it must be noted that all the representatives of the United Kingdom, the political groups, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, very vigorously defended, and they were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, in March of this year, the directive on Passenger cableway installations were adopted.
We believe that, in these cases, trade is not burdened with the Herstellerpflichten Produktsicherheitsgesetzes may be used.
We have justifications for them and for the resumption of the arguments heard the industry, which were put forward in committee.
It should be enough if the vendor the buyer general information on products and this lack of information and documents out.
Finally small request to the European Commission to Article 4 on European standards and whether these should be published.
The Verkaufseinrichtungen charities and public utilities existing exemptions and derogations for markets or the boot sale to second-hand goods to be welcomed by me.
The safety and reliability of customer service increase the value of the European label in particular indicative and difficult moment.
If we elsewhere to call on the Commission, in the near future with a proposal on the safety of services to present, cannot see why we are aspects of services now intend to regulate, rather than waiting for a proposal from the Commission, and it is emerging now Abgrenzungsschwierigkeiten arise between the various regulations and the legal increase over time.
I would like the priorities of this proposal explain.
We are allowing the opening of the system for third countries, in particular the applicant countries, we have the procedures for the implementation of emergency measures at Community level to be simplified, so that we have a regulatory committee recommendation actively immediately.
As a result of this new provision that shops no significant additional responsibility.
The proposal in Amendment No 11, the word 'producer' with 'service providers' would not create clarity, but rather confusion, because the directive does not definition of the term 'service providers' contains.
The Commission supports the rapid establishment of such a network, but it must be put to the vote among the Member States.
One such certification can be used as evidence, but it offers no complete safety.
I have explained at length why the Commission Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and part of Amendment No 7, and the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendment No 27 and 34 reject, but the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21, and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, because the Commission's proposal improves these amendments and receives more clarity.
Clearly, we must, in the view of Mr Barón Crespo as an Italian socialist, not the Group of the Party of European Socialists belong.
I believe that between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37 is no contradiction.
With regard to the order in which I will leave it to the President, but I would remind you that, in any event, I am opposed to all the amendments I am.
It is not the EU belonging to the Mediterranean countries in terms of economic development is undoubtedly very serious problems. This regional disparities which exist there constant tension.
With regard to the respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, must, in the spirit of a harmonised European immigration policy together with suitable instruments for ensuring fair treatment of these immigrants instruments for financial support for all those young people to be created, undertake a in-house and higher education in the countries of Europe return to their country of origin want to include a profession there.
I should like to highlight a factor that I really decisive question in this regard: the lack of equality in the labour market.
Although) Late, but the Commission programme for the support of the Community framework strategy for equality between women and men (2001 - 2005) tabled by previous programmes and, in particular, by the end of this year due to expire Fourth Framework Programme striking is different.
For a number of improvements have taken account of my group, and asked for studies on the situation of women in the labour market and the lack of access to comment insurance systems, for which we are substantial statistics need gender data.
- My party has serious reservations with regard to the application of Community law on the sale of consumer goods instead of applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
Now we understand, and the Labour amendments tabled offer the guarantee that charities shops remain intact and are exempt from the directive.
Finally, the Amendment 15 by the Commission can be a free hand in the Agency’s language, which, in our view, a very worrying development.
The simplification of the decision-making process, the establishment of decentralised operational centres (not only in Pristina, what its separation of Yugoslavia would be equivalent) and the solution to the problem of dual structure with the management board and the Management Committee could be seen as positive measures to remedy the considerable administrative shortcomings within the European Agency for Reconstruction, turn out to be.
We are therefore voting against the Commission's proposal and Parliament's report.
A adaptation of existing Community legislation in this area can therefore be seen as justified.
Furthermore, the Fund is an opportunity to form of cofinancing by Member States are more or less covert amount of state aid.
. (EL) Despite its serious shortcomings in the Morillon report clearly goes further than the Commission's proposal on the partnership agreement between the European Union and Turkey.
We, on the other hand, voted against.
We must, as well as the rapporteur recognises Turkey's progress in a number of areas and positive signals have been made.
Our Parliament has already since 1987 used for this recognition, and the adoption of this amendment is evidence of the coherence of Parliament on this issue.
The Union must make more concrete proposals and enlargement to include Turkey as an essential geopolitical policy decisions.
Such innocent Europe and not worthy of Turkey.
For several years I, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada the operation of these regional organisations, the NAFO (Organization for fisheries in the North-Western Atlantic area, seeing that the countries of this region, including Canada, and all those in this region using traditional fishing zones, including France, Spain and other European countries.
It will only be satisfied if their own Kanonenbootflotte Sternenkreisbanner under their fisheries policy will prevail.
The most important thing, therefore, is not to satisfy the hegemony of the Commission by the European position weakens what a proper implementation of the principle of subsidiarity would be completely disagree with.
At the end of the day after laborious negotiations, the final result deserves to be defended.
With this proposal, the replacement of three directives on waste incineration aims, that is to say, seeking to the quality of the air, water, soil and improve public health by emissions from Schmutzpartikeln in connection with the incineration and co-incineration, and in particular the emission of dioxins and furans reduce heavy metals.
It is also important to draw attention to the innovation that it is now no longer only emissions into the air, but also into the water and the soil's speech.
While dealing with the proposal has been improved.
It is also much stricter Stickoxidgrenzwerte new co-incineration, such as cement kilns is a step forward, which is an incentive to reduce emissions, even though the proposed standards not just the latest state of the art reflected.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me particularly you, Mr Blokland, I am few minutes late.
Finally, I would like to say that this directive is an essential contribution towards reducing the negative effects on the environment and the risks to human health.
It would be to the European Parliament credit if it is in the name of the rejection of any form of discrimination, the fight against exclusion and given the responsibility of the individual introduction giving new impetus, would the practical implementation of the essential solidarity allows.
From the country, however great differences, and in the absence of detailed and comparable statistics reliable indicate which system where the way in which provides the best results where its weaknesses, etc. However, precisely in my speaking on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy opinion stressed the need for the Commission to define any universal rules for Zusatzkrankenversicherung Green Paper published them all these scattered data and the relevant information compiled and evaluated.
So far, this has been a taboo subject, in a manner of speaking.
The risk of not very healthy citizens and older people because of their high risk limited private Insure Gesellschaftsentwicklung not acceptable.
The second approach, which the rapporteur explained in his introduction and supported by many colleagues, involves the promotion of the necessary rules and codes of conduct for forms of mutual responsibility for payment between insurers, the provision of high-quality services and guarantee the risks of creating discriminatory practices and Kundenauswahl risk and counter-productive.
In my opinion, it cannot be right to depend on money, who is high on the waiting list.
The new proposal by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to begin by carrying out an assessment in the form of a Green Paper and then to decide whether we have a directive or a recommendation need.
In the Netherlands changes are currently under discussion in the system.
On this basis, the Commission should take an initiative and specific principles and guidelines for articulating the health systems of the Member States.
Absolute 'one size fits all' approach therefore Insuring unlikely.
That is why I believe that we should Mr Rocard on his report, in which he, the Commission services, the Green Paper invites us a glimpse into the current state of insurance in the Member States and, at the same time, the decision allows for the future, and to congratulate him agree with him.
Both building Dreisäulenmodell: the public, business and the private sector.
With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced some rules in doing so, it has presented a Green Paper on the proposal for a directive has emerged.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rocard and congratulate him on his report, and I congratulate Mr Marinos to the opinion of its Committee.
This study on the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the initiatives and measures.
With regard to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to say that they have all been adopted.
We voted in favour of the indicators of the programme, multi-dimensional undertaking the phenomenon of measures in the areas of health, education and housing, coherence and complementarity with other neighbouring areas and the participation of non-state agencies, but also social exclusion people themselves count.
This means that we cyclical growth periods must use a balance or surplus to create.
I remind you that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission to next year precisely these long-term aspect of public finances in relation to the ageing of the population, to be included in the assessment.
One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands, special consideration - as I said at the beginning, the impact of the ageing of the population on the budget for the coming years.
That is why this opens the accounts for the year 2000 in Germany a surplus of one and a half points of the gross domestic product.
Let us Wechselkursentwicklung the euro adds to the dollar, we have a clear negative impact on inflation.
Furthermore, seeking to public contributory system with private Kapitalbildungssystemen compatible, and they are obviously aid for specific investment funds can be reconciled. long-term tax and perhaps solve the problem of the ageing of the population are helpful.
Hence the third chief principle, the precautionary principle.
It must be remembered that, at present, a number of proposals for legislation to be discussed all the efficiency and effectiveness of Community provisions, and therefore, as I hope, strengthen the confidence of consumers.
But this is a relatively low rate of prevalence is no cause for complacency.
To be honest, I was disappointed that the statement yesterday by Prime Minister Jospin 's extremely positive role in the Community in recent years has not been recognised.
Of course, we must increased incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States statements.
The Commission's Veterinary Office, which highlights the safeguards against BSE controls in the Member States already high priority.
With regard to its security, I would like to repeat that there is already a series of controls to ensure that meat and bone meal in the transmission of BSE is not a threat.
Yes, we may hardly believe that it has taken four years to approve a measure, for the protection of public health and consider fundamental.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I strongly urge that the Council should, at long last, its opinion on the regulation on TSEs announced.
In the current situation, the only way to break the cycle of BSE-Infektion the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs completely ban.
In this regard, I would like to mention that we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party tabled an amendment, which I hope will be adopted.
The policy must change so that this crisis is really responsible reminded of their duty and specific decisions is a first step towards the end of this terrible crisis.
They must therefore be reviewed.
The agreed labelling for beef, a Mindestetikettierung only been in force for two and a half months, allowing no proper traceability, the origin of the animals, and specified risk material, we have banned far too late.
The citizens must be fully on the characteristics of the tests I have mentioned to be informed.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you had nothing, or almost nothing is done, as well as your colleagues in the light of the consequences of Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic and the contaminated blood inaction and reason has been given to the public does not want to create panic.
The French ban on massive Bedarfssteigerung ensure the supply of raw materials is limited.
Consumers have lost their confidence, and the phenomenon stop must be introduced compulsory BSE in cattle and sheep.
What is more important is now working in the spirit of the Commission's proposal that the use of meat and bone meal meet the highest safety standards.
Otherwise, I am, once, entirely agree with what the honourable, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête said.
For now, in going to the Council and the Commission, you have sufficient financial basis and can now implement a vigorous policy.
We must tackle this problem.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am very pleased to hear in this House that the CAP at any price review.
We have the land, the appropriate climate and the necessary Know how meal immediately not genetically modified Pflanzenproteine to replace, and yet we have decided not to the law on our own soil for the feeding of our animals and the people of food crops Pflanzenproteine required, while at the same time we are funding set-aside land. why our group has tabled an amendment in which the Council and the Commission are called upon to find ways of Europe in the cultivation of these Pflanzenproteine back to increase adequate substitute for prionenhaltiges meal and American genetically modified soya represent.
The food must be safe food people’s guarantee.
I think it is an example that France has managed to take this step forward.
But them the cannot.
That is why I am surprised that in these circumstances dead or may be processed or recycled.
Recently in Britain Phillips-Untersuchung published on BSE.
I would like to suggest to the European Commission, the precautionary principle with regard to beef from France also apply.
We still have no certainty and must therefore know how the scientific facts and what needs to be done.
In addition, of course, I have noted all the proposals that I am aware.
If the citizens of the Member States and tell me that legislation would not be properly or not fully implemented, then perhaps we would have to consider once again, but not because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because it is in the European Union in compliance with the law is lacking.
If we do not want to hear invites the best did not even.
The Commission is of the opinion that the readmission agreements for the clarification and coordination of these measures play an important role, and currently under way, the negotiations on the first Community readmission agreement with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.
What proposals on this, the Commission has based on Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union?
(The President cut the speaker off)
The aim of this period was the reduction of the public deficit in order to achieve a good monetary policy, lower interest rates and a greater growth.
I always say that the euro is introduced on 1 January 2002, we have it in our pockets, and we have to different coins, but we bear it in our pockets.
The current limit values for nitrogen dioxide and lead was not exceeded, not Ozon-Schwellenwert in the inner city in Athens under Directive 92 72/EC, but it should be noted that the measurements made Hochsommer.
Subject: State aid for the audiovisual sector a seminar of the French Presidency, on the subject of cultural industries was a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition in the Commission's view that broadcasters imposed legal Investitionsverpflichtungen solely by the fact that the compulsory Legislatures would constitute state aid.
It is to respect and protect. '
But that is not itself, because the new growth is very inegalitär and, as we have in the United States for about a decade observe ongoing phenomena of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty and urban ghettos accompanied.
The governments of the Member States have not accepted this definition, which is something simple and meaningless.
In the emerging harsh climate, there are more and more people who cannot compete, sidelined and excluded.
Mr President, in this House, we often hear similar litany of what the European social model or the social market economy is to be praised, as many believe, opposed to the chaotic model of the United States of America would form.
(technical disruption).
This is a huge figure.
In addition, all of which should be involved political levels.
I agree that it is necessary to the causes of poverty to know better than I am in favour of preventive measures through innovative and practical responses involving the social partners, local and national administrations and joint action by the citizens against exclusion as a result of mergers, restructuring and relocation of businesses, desertification and strong human settlement of urban areas.
We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reform.
This is a legal problem because in the text of the Treaty only on social exclusion and not on poverty referred.
These proposals are, I think, a pragmatic answer to your request.
However, support for the strategy does not necessarily mean support for the detail.
If we have a clear, binding framework for the Member States to define, the different systems, these requirements must be met by a long time suspended.
Renewable energy sources are not a panacea for solving this problem; nobody doubts that considerably mitigate its and diversification of energy sources and to reduce our dependence on oil and gas can help, which also obtaining good.
I should like to three reiterate our demands.
The setting of realistic Zielrichtwerte only the confidence of the people in followed increase energy policy.
I believe that a consistent policy in the field of renewable energy sources Symbolwirkung for the future Europe.
These agreements, after all, the Member States of the European Union must show that it is a contribution to achieving the Kyoto objectives do.
It would be a pity if a category would exclude the overall profit-making energy from waste can contribute either for small projects or as part of the accounts.
The creation of Torfmasse assimilation and Waldstreuentstehung resembles other plant biomass.
Mr Chichester, I should like to say that I Heimatküste at sea are already very modern wind farms have been installed. project, which is certainly very quickly taken in operation.
The dispute about the abandonment of nuclear power, including Sweden and Germany, has shown that there is no visible environmentally-friendly and competitive price of energy alternatives inevitably debate washed away.
That is why the Member States must draw up binding targets.
That is why I am optimistic as far as Zukunftspotential renewable sources of energy, provided the right incentives.
I believe that we have heard a great deal of courage to renewable energy constantly adjust as they deserve.
There is a very strong oil price rises undoubtedly brings us more strength to bear in mind the problems of our dependence on fossil energy sources combined.
Consequently, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.
This respect but very terms not infringe upon constitute its right of initiative and that they are not incompatible with the internal electricity market must be.
In the Commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where 25 000 widows, living in 26 participants only one woman.
Although the number of women has been relatively small, studies have proven that the presence of women in the peacekeeping forces of the UN to improve relations with the local population and the general Morality lead.
The report by Mrs Theorin in this area very in detail and repeat that we as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats asking, in terms of removing official document.
Politically speaking, I can Amendment No 19, rather than tactical failure or tactical Retreat interpreted as substantial compromise and consider the problem really shameful.
They were imprisoned.
Portugal, where women until 1974 Aprilrevolution were given access to diplomacy, recently in East Timor and our ambassador in Indonesia, Ana Gomes shown how the role of women and their awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people that 25 years alone in its fight for freedom was around the world, and particularly in the European Parliament can be carried out.
So far only very few of them have done two or three, as I understand it.
It is therefore necessary to continue this dimension in the development policy of the European Union will be taken into account.
Unfortunately the terms is not defined, and no distinctions made.
Please ask the Council to our protest.
They are people with other experiences, experience, governance and, in particular, for the settlement of disputes are essential.
The debate is closed.
Secondly, if the industry law must, of course, be looked into a number of points.
In the last few weeks I have noticed that both sides Gewerkschaftskreise international and certain national trade unions interest.
The second point: Are you for housewives receive benefits?
All those who currently undeclared work, received a job in decent social conditions.
Furthermore this project result often two to three families united and budgetary support needs to be considered together.
We were just a plenary session during the first October, when we in our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the courageous reaction of the Serbian people, we learned, whereupon immediately, you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of sanctions international called for.
In this way, Europe has the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and its political creativity in shaping the future Entwicklungswegs demonstrated.
There must be no doubt that the issue of the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy.
On the other hand, we would like to have a chance to show Europe that we ourselves and in recognition of the true democratic principles capable of constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia to develop.
I have to say that I, and at that time I spoke to you, very impressed by this matter, as you this extremely difficult situation meisterten and firmly as you.
The next protocol put right, Mr Watson.
Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions will enable citizens to the decision-making bodies accountable and proposes greater efficiency.
The fifth amendment is an important one, in my opinion, annual reports, particularly on the documents must remain confidential or at least still secret.
This issue is resolved, and the possibility of rules more transparent, only remain in force, and, amongst other things, to this point, we have tabled amendments.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is opposed to the draft documents, foreign policy and security issues affecting automatically and as a whole to be exempted from the principle of public access to official records.
If we want the citizens really exercise their rights, we need these contact points specifically trained staff, the information seeking citizens a sense of hands and Scouts complicated maze of the institutions.
Registers are essential if we do not want the public insider public access.
It is very gratifying that Parliament has managed to a broad majority in favour of creating greater transparency.
Mr President, I would like to start thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work.
Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are no good light.
If so, then that is a miscalculation, because what is at stake is the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.
In document today we understand the different things and we want a comprehensive possible access to many Dokumenttypen various forms of guarantee.
Mr President, the Commission's attitude to the documents from the internal manual shows on 11 October the employees of the Commission was distributed and informed as requests for access to documents dealt with by Members of Parliament.
This provision must be removed or, at least, the duty of citizen’s supplements.
The traditional form of international cooperation with the diplomatic traditions and rules, for example, that everything takes place behind closed doors - is not appropriate for modern cooperation, as developed by the European Union.
We should it not the role of the European Parliament or future confuse interinstitutional agreements.
It is a step forward for the use of the right of citizens to information and knowledge.
However, it is not the only one, and I would like to thank very I should also like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the basis of the Hughes procedure consolidated co-author of the report.
Transparency must be one of the pillars of the activities of the European Union as a whole, the law is sufficient insight into the documents for the implementation of transparency does not in itself.
The European Parliament asks that the European security and defence policy in future in the structures of the European Commission involved.
As President Prodi on 3 October went to Parliament, he spoke of institutional triangle and pointed out that a checks and balances based European system for the proper functioning of each institution's contribution to the common interest.
I must admit that the great challenge of this regulation is to specify the documents.
I would like to point out that the Commission, when the time comes practically the whole of the could accept amendments such as Nos.
In some cases, I would like to vote in favour of the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Members of this House would have to list the amendments which the Commission can support, and with the amendments which they do not want to support in hand.
credit own resources
Finally, and this is the most controversial point, the committee demanded a strongly fast-track procedure for the implementation of this legislation.
These amendments replace several other proposals in the report that the vote will probably be rejected and replaced by the new amendments, the outcome of this consensus.
Mr President, the excellent vote in favour of this report and the response of the Commission this morning, clearly, if you look at all the parts which we have voted - we are in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the vote on the draft legislative resolution should be postponed, with the Commission and the Council in the success of the negotiations.
Mr President, I am sorry to say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE) supports the postponement of the vote, but I must point out that your coordinator, I have come to inform me that you vote for session of November II wanted to postpone, rather than vote tonight.
I would be for another reason to propose a postponement of the vote, Mr Goebbels said, this is a very important matter.
I do not know what a roll-call vote costs, but it is certainly a few thousand francs or Belgian francs from our budget.
I know that in France, whole herds have been slaughtered, and it does not seem to be the best solution.
removal of meal feed, and not only for cattle and sheep and pigs and poultry fish
This is not acceptable.
Such provisions would be likely to restore the confidence of consumers and farmers should send the message of solidarity that we want to send them.
There is an urgent need to go further, and changes to the common agricultural policy will need to be considered.
The ban on the use of meat and bone meal as animal feed is only the first step on this path.
We, on the other hand, very much regret that the amendments tabled by our group were not support.
In my opinion, it would be logical to working hours for workers to reduce polluting companies.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise once again that the overall distribution of hazardous waste recovery we cannot accept production of such waste.
If, for example, pensions would not be so low that livelihoods are not enough, there would be less poor.
The report provides EUR 100 million for a period of five years to reduce poverty.
The proposal that a second Luxembourg process in the field of social exclusion, to start involving guidelines and national action plans will receive my unqualified support.
The report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.
In presenting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission request from the Council 'June 2000' initiative on cooperation in this area to draw up '.
Mr President, I have a very specific reason abstained, this report I think that in environmental terms not progress has been made, I wanted and had hoped for.
I hope that this system in all the cities of Europe will spread.
Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and not my support.
There must also be better in the future be able to existing Bestpractice publicly known.
Umweltbewusste redirection given the option of a liberalised market voluntarily to contribute to cleaner energy and, on the other hand, all in the old remains.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
There are three reasons for this: firstly, it is in line with the process of consolidating democracy and increased demand for respect for human rights, especially with regard to the indigenous communities.
In this debate we want, as previous speakers have said correctly, solidarity and support for our institution to the Central American Parliament expressed as is happening at a time when we are to get the external relations of the European Union with the countries of Latin continues to be given priority.
I have no reservations about human rights, our colleague and dear friend, Mr Seguro, President of the delegation responsible for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, was authorised to say.
Finally, the Commission in dialogue with the Central American authorities have reiterated the importance of the fact that regional integration as an instrument for consolidating the democratisation and development must take place in this area.
In order to cling to power, he has not hesitated to absurd debate on "birthright" to appropriating a wave of xenophobia provoked, hatred of the other ``alien Burkinabé or Malinesen much for many years ivorischem land live and work.
The prerequisite for producing a real democracy in Côte d'Ivoire, the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry of the crimes committed, and the formal obligation to respect for human rights and internal peace.
Some people think that democracy is relative importance when it comes to Africa, are complex procedures and should be the time for work, but I believe that it is in terms of democracy can be no compromise and Côte d'Ivoire today the same question, such as in Guinea, where we know that people are imprisoned and there is no democratic system.
Finally, I would like to say one thing: dictatorships are only possible because people are living in poverty, which do not have access to knowledge and knowledge.
It would not be illogical if the European Union is now called for new presidential elections, this time all the candidates could participate.
In very many parts of Africa, we have very different ethnic and religious mixtures.
These elections must be nationwide representation of the political parties will enable excluded from the presidential election, if only partially, the shortcomings of this first election balance.
on the situation in Burma.
There will be a large-scale offensive against the Shan and led to the Karen people and, as the UN-Berichterstatter said, there is no sign of a dialogue between SDPC and the NLD.
That is why we stress the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
I hope that the European Parliament is dealing with this issue in the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance to the people of Burma gives a clear signal that their plight bear in mind that we recognise that the situation in Burma worse rather than better, and that we are determined to do something about it.
It has taken a long time.
It is precisely in Asia, there is a risk that decouple economic and political reform, economic progress and economic liberalisation without liberalisation in the political sphere and without strengthening the rule of law, although I believe that without a functioning state under the rule of law in the long term, trade and investment subsidies are lost.
Mr President, I can in many of the previous speakers agree with major issues, for much of what is happening in Vietnam today is not acceptable.
The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, which Mr Swoboda has mentioned, now declared that Vietnam, especially in the matter of human rights recently made a number of moves to improve the situation.
The top secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of the Vietnamese government policy.
However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation only dialogue between the military regime, the democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities can be achieved.
There is a clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of self-censorship one’s press.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
We also need the support of the European Union, not only in the south-west of England, but in all areas affected.
I would ask you all to support our resolution.
It is important that the European Union is not exceptional aid measures for the entry of disasters is limited.
In this context, the Commission has taken two initiatives.
Mr President, it is a purely linguistic error on the inclusion of the amendments that have occurred in the joint motion for a resolution.
The vote will be postponed, the task of the Commission to be postponed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The report is the observation that there is a growing proportion of health care in Europe is covered by Zusatzkrankenversicherungen.
I think it is rather strange that the Commission is now in the hands of a proposal for a directive link, but at the same time a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and Krankenzusatzversicherungen requested by the Commission.
In view of the fact that the proportion of elderly people in the population is rising sharply, it is important to improve the health of people throughout Europe will need to be considered.
We cannot go along with that.
Mr President, I welcome much in favour of a fast-track procedure for the implementation of the results of the Basle rewrite Kapitaladäquanz-Regelungsrahmens.
As far as the sense of urgency, Mrs Villiers gave the Commission feels the need to dissociate by adopting the measures in a fast-track procedure, to say that the rapporteur acknowledges that this system no impact on anti-competitive practices, which unfortunately prevalent in the United States.
We must be careful that Basel does not lead to extra banks higher capital requirements a second disadvantage by.
Having said that I would like to point out that the operators, in my view, the approach seen as satisfactory, the rules on capital, issues relating to the risk of abstützen lies.
These are some of the initial ideas as to how we, within the current rules of the Treaty could reach a rapid process of scrutiny and would effectively.
Indeed, the time has come to recognise that the institution of the European Ombudsman 'mature enough and sufficient evidence that the maturity of our own budget has.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that the competences of the European Ombudsman should be extended, and the sooner the better, particularly with regard to Article 3 of the resolution of 1994 established the Ombudsman's investigative powers.
An Ombudsman, of course, is subject to the rules governing confidentiality, but it is important for the citizens to know that he or she as Ombudsman access to documents received other people remain closed.
The starting point for this report on this problem then the Ombudsman directed at the Commission's recommendation, it organised competitions access for female candidates and their own amended to allow auditing work.
We believe that the recruitment of the Community institutions, and indeed all of the recruitment, with maximum transparency and openness should go any suspicion of partiality, injustice or incompetence of the administration excluded.
I refer, for example, to an amendment on the request for the indisputable evidence orally.
Mr Bösch is already briefly on the amendments to the report have been received.
Having listened to the Commission two questions on the implementation and organisation of the last internal competition were tabled, I have a precise and detailed answers.
For example, red open and transparent.
Firstly, the audits carried out by the Commission are made corrections always anonymously.
Two such changes was clearly July 2000.
Votes
(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)
In evaluating the directive on own resources of credit institutions must be carefully number of conflict between the interests of balance.
That is the idea of a European police academy for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries have arisen.
That is the position of the rapporteur, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shares it too.
The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union necessarily require real cross-border cooperation between the different police forces.
The most of the previous speakers appear to believe that it is essential that the College a permanent seat.
The umpteenth temporary, but not widerrufliche decision, the Council is usually Parliament makes a small gift.
The rapporteur also wants to Kriminalitätsvorbeugung provision of services, innovation and monitoring of the borders involved know and the protection of internal security in terms of public order to see changed.
These were the ideals that suggerierten and saw the state impact.
A race standards in certain Member States of the European Union, I would welcome.
Since the first deliberations on this matter, the initiative of the European Parliament have been done at European level, the Commission has committed itself to the Member States, with the aim of action on the way to build something which we, as European Polizeikultur could look at the highest state of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the people and the effectiveness of the fight against crime is based.
This development plans with the Police College intergovernmental.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.
- (SV) I have opposed the provisional establishment of the European Police College voted.
There is no doubt that many of our courts very slowly and cautiously work, and it is very difficult to these issues a quick to take action.
Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since it is based on the Brussels II regulation, which are not children living separately and unmarried parents’ applies.
My mother such divorce and kidnapping 85 years ago was involved, and they still talk.
That is why I would like to say to the House that the Commission action plan on the mutual recognition of civil decisions, hopefully before the end of the year, decided to propose extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, consequently, this regulation on visiting rights and top priority must be attached to make no difference to children married couples be regarded as well as children of cohabiting couples.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
In the meantime, sport, it must be said, closely linked to other sectors, such as companies in the audiovisual sector or advertising and Sportartikelverkauf.
What we need is a wise, flexible interpretations of the current rules.
Strictly speaking, this is an attack on democracy, so we fight to see things from this point of view.
The Commission is therefore expected shortly respond to its request for detailed information on the measures envisaged by the British Government.
The proposal by the finance ministers, in connection with a draft half a year before the statement on the budget presented in spring 2001.
I think that what Mr Simpson said extraordinary way, contributed to the probable intentions of the United Kingdom Government to confirm this.
By traffic jams, not only would we lose a lot of time to arise not only high costs, but particularly for the environment is a very big problem, and I therefore believe that, if the British Government actually uses the money to solve the problems, then all benefit from that, all the citizens of Europe.
We are more or less the only oil in the European Union and yet the highest petrol and diesel by all the countries of Europe, 1,20 pound we pay in the United Kingdom for a litre of diesel.
That concludes this item.
The European Parliament is duty bound to assure them that their side I again ask you to observe a minute 's silence for our solidarity and to express our shock.
Madam President, I would like to support this proposal fully, because I am one of those who have requested to include this point.
We have made good progress.
The EU is its relationship with the major groups and also develop as quickly as possible with the new government in the United States contacts.
In view of this, what a surprise, Mr Prescott enthusiastic report on the deal that he had negotiated, I do not understand why it is not only Mrs Voynet, but, as I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, by almost all the other European ministers was rejected.
Now there is a danger that we have lost the momentum of the American negotiator change its position and in May, we absolutely must begin again.
The great controversy forests this time.
A constant warming would result in some EU countries flooded parts of their territory or versteppt.
You have a high standard of living and low prices for petroleum products.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Wallström on her efforts in The Hague and wish it more successful.
No doubt it was better to come to any agreement as bad as the American proposal was totally inadequate and Europe in no way acceptable.
Climate change in the developing countries far-reaching consequences.
I would like to reiterate in English: Forest turns from being carbon sinks' to carbon sources.
Only if the European Union is to remain credible in the discussions and the real action on the COP6- 'B' in Bonn, the initiative.
We need our own assessment of the events and make prepare documents with the various parties and, of course, the 'Umbrella-Gruppe contacts.
Of course, there is a step after the forthcoming COP 6 or the continuation of COP 6 that the agreement in the Union is ratified.
In the European Council, we will, Mr Moscovici and I next Sunday Klausursitzung at ministerial level to implement, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos invited, on Monday, during the General Affairs Council meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference.
The minimum number of participating countries should be set at eight, while the possibility of a unanimous decision by the Council to demand that the de facto currently represents a veto Anrufungsrecht replaced.
It is regrettable, but I have to stick to this fact.
The European Council will be the state of enlargement negotiations and, consequently, to deal with enlargement.
The Lisbon European Council had guidelines for the promotion of innovative and competitive Europe is adopted.
Consumer protection is, for obvious reasons, which I do not need to dwell, an increasingly important concerns of Europeans.
We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.
This is, in fact, the criterion which we ultimately the Nice Summit must be evaluated.
(Applause)
Firstly, the candidate countries must adopt the acquis communautaire and implement it, our task.
We are keen to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we do not want just a great promoted.
However, the text could be better worded, but it can also be improved after Nice and made more specific.
I think it is simply unacceptable that a number of governments, the inclusion of a reference to the Charter of Article 6 of the Treaty simply brushed off the table.
They do not want to enter into the Treaties, which is proof that this text that Elaborat set aside.
The WTO is an appalling voice arise.
I believe that, given the rather gloomy prospects for the Intergovernmental Conference, the burden more complex and controversial issue would not be a clever move.
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency to do our utmost to ensure that this gap is closed, because it affects highly destructive.
On trade, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be considered.
Although the previous Treaty, some progress has been made on the extension of the formula could be made so that the absurd formula of codecision, including unanimity on matters of nationality, social security, reception and exercising independent activities and cultural policy was launched.
The fact that this question is clear evidence of the failure of a policy to strengthen the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the European Union.
That is the situation we are in this Intergovernmental Conference set for months, because no one be abandoning toys.
The experience of this year, lead us to the statement that we progress to Nice in view of the future of Europe, in the European Union Konstitutionalisierungsprozess must be made, not now depleted method solely between the government negotiations must trust.
Will the qualified majority does not rule that Mr Prodi has quite rightly noted earlier, definitively blocked the decision-making process.
This aspect of the principle of subsidiarity in our debate does not mention, however, is very important.
We have the 1995 enlargement has taken place, Carlos Westendorp so careful reflection group chairman, Amsterdam, and now we are going to Nice and almost at the same point, Mr President: We revolve institutional issues, without solutions which allow us to fulfil a very demanding task of enlargement to 27.
Let us not disappointment that the Nice Conference already cause if it ends without, as a result of this, the disappointment of the peoples of our Parliament to add.
In the past, we have shown that this objective is possible, and as a citizen of a Member State, the planned transition to membership has benefited, an enlarged and peaceful Europe with great unexpectedly.
However, even if it has a veto must be clear for everyone else to apply.
But first change in 2004 elected Parliament will be needed because some Member States at least before the elections or during the legislative period 2004-2009.
The President-in-Office of the Council has raised the question of closer cooperation and stated that it is moving in this matter of consensus.
Mr President, the first look at Nice leftovers' and the necessary adjustments of enlargement.
Besäßen we only a glimmer of those mentality because we have negative developments in our part of the world showed less emphasis and positive progress processes in the sharper focus could, then we would be happier than is the case at present.
We should not just goods, but also built services, investment, intellectual property and competition in the decision of a majority of the Council of Ministers and include the paragraph of Article 133 of the Treaty change accordingly.
One of the right of initiative of the European Parliament would, however, also in this sensitive issue party pave the way to arbitrariness.
We must therefore be able, as you have said, when he American optimism and reinforce the way in which the Americans talk to highlight this, what can go ahead.
I would also like to say that I believe that it is not a problem for large and small countries.
We have done a great deal, but we always come back to the old problem, and I do not believe that development would occur, simply because one country moves, because this is what I should like to reiterate very strong national political, democratic realities in twelve fifteen countries.
Mr President, Mr Védrine, you have noticed that perhaps there is spannungsgeladenes climate, and you have a degree of pessimism mentioned.
In addition, I would ask you to do everything possible to ensure that the safety requirements adequately to tighten up so that such an incident does not happen again.
I believe that we have to make arrangements that we have still not taken the guests of this Parliament in this House as guests can feel at home, and not the fear of threats have.
hospitality, hospitality and respect there.
Thank you very much, Mr Tajani.
The best honor we Lluch Ernest and his life prove to follow its message, in Catalan means dìaleg. we can all the dialogue in the Basque country has a chance?
On the other hand, of course, anyone can express his opinion.
(B5-0549/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan;
I am talking about organisation, I believe that the European Union, such great effort should be given responsibility.
Secondly, you will be in the resolution on the clear will of Parliament say that security and defence policy to balance two pillars to establish, civil crisis management and, in the event of failure to military crisis management, with these two pillars complement each other.
Mr President, in view of the late have already occurred and the commitments I have today, I will try to the speech I had prepared to reduce.
These relations are particularly meetings between the North Atlantic Council and COPSI and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries and/or produced allies.
Let us take as an example the events in the Balkans, we can say that everyone has fulfilled its role to the full.
During this period we have the United States fully on developments in the context of the European security and defence policy kept informed, which is an essential requirement for them to develop harmoniously, as it is currently the case.
For example, the second annual European Union report on human rights submitted to the European Parliament and the forum to be held in Paris on 13 December.
This policy, you will see that seeks not competitors of the Atlantic Alliance, which is now the basis of collective defence of its members and establish a permanent European army.
However, the figure of 100 000 men have mentioned, this does not mean that we laid down in Helsinki trying to outdo objective, but that we have a reserve of different qualifications and specialisation have ensured that the Council's objective of the 60 000 men under all conditions can be achieved.
I would like very briefly to most of our public accepts real political sense to go into this new task, Europe has so far been missing becomes an instrument of political influence.
However, we are facing a problem that must ensure that when we consolidate the liberal democracy in Europe is what the whole continent believe because that is what it is all about enlargement and the enlargement process.
There are three areas that we need a coherent whole combination of Community policies, the common foreign and security policy, including the ESDP and national measures in the Member States.
Despite the costly procedure within the Commission, we do not need 60 000 troops powerful force to achieve our objectives.
It is essential, therefore, is a way of providing humanitarian aid can be found.
I do not agree with the cynics who say that Europe is getting so Toying nothing to do. It is true that the Rapid Reaction Force in many situations not immediately applicable.
The EU should not have its own defence forces solid form.
I would like to conclude my group's concern over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan to say, and the Commission and call upon the Council, insofar as it is possible to their efforts for a peaceful solution and to increase aid to the civilian population, especially now the onset of winter.
To simple phrase: Where when and how the European Rapid Reaction Force should be used in future?
The interview makes it clear how the appalling record of these two months intifada has come about 270 deaths, mostly Palestinians and nearly 10 000 for life often disabled people injured alone.
That is why it is constantly trying to's weapons of mass destruction schrecklichster sort of standards.
Secondly, and contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible and desirable that the European Union, in the light of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East is doing more than has hitherto been the case, especially now, during the transitional period of the United States.
Mr President, in my speech I would like to comment on the report by Mrs Lalumière, which I think is very good and clearly formulated.
But there is no political concept, and there is real still no common foreign and security policy.
The EU has only one problem, Öffentlichkeitsinteresse such action has not been won, although this is much more viable and much more effective.
Another point is, of course, the question of the distribution of the budget.
That is what I express variety, despite the obvious assurances on this subject in the last few days as coincidence repeatedly heard.
Our potential is still very limited. Member States should finally review their defence which countries differ considerably.
Even those who value of the decision, for example, to the creation of the so-called army investigate, the major political content of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union recognised.
The first appearance of Defence Minister in our Parliament is historic, it is reserved for the sitting, so that the impression of our Members are not too.
All these conflicts, civil crisis prevention is better than a military action.
If Russia in the long term, political Unionspartner an undemocratic regime?
Europe will therefore pose no new military alliance, as some - as I believe, probably on the basis of incomplete information, have mentioned.
I have pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure a resolution to wind up the debate received.
Given the extent of the challenge four committees concerned, and therefore a new procedure for the preparation of four reports to be applied simultaneously.
The measures proposed in the White Paper must in their entirety serve to the operation of the Commission to modernise and become more effective.
It would therefore be appropriate to reform to give their action to limit the areas which do not involve expenditure.
The Bewertungsunterschiede occurred not only political but reflects all the cultural differences between the Fifteen.
The main task of the Internal Audit Service, which you, Mr Kinnock, the reform of the vice-president responsible directly subject to the analysis of the internal control and systems within the Commission.
The cooperation has great fun, and I believe that the process of the Commission to undertake a major reform that for the future of the European Union is crucial in depth and wealth won, because we have four involved.
They should expect put in other European institutions or the national governments will disappear, and to work in the private sector.
That is why our committee emphasises once again how important it is for a strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically accountable Commission attaches.
As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the budget of the activities because of the limited visibility of expenditure and because of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority problems.
Parliament's determination to illustrate this reform to impose, together with the Commission.
Mr President, I should like first of all to all four rapporteurs for the work she has carried out.
This is shameful, in view of the fact that the EU itself champion the modernisation of economic life.
Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteur to support the work of the Commission, it remains a fact that the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts no comprehensive and consistent response in terms of striving for a real government, and not only for better management of the Commission.
The amended position should be its expression in a transparent administration.
I believe that the world is not a structure with a richer and more important than the 15 tomorrow’s 20 or more countries, an entire continent. most industrialised part of the globe pulsiert in the European Union and the Commission on the structures.
Changes are never easy.
In this context, the Socialist Group believes, however, that the management of the Community is currently working very effectively.
It is familiar with the result that many members of the Commission and its administration and expertly looked at this in depth.
Thousands of Projektanträgen have already been waiting a year of evaluation.
As we have seen, the debate is not so much a question of principles, objectives and opportunities for reform, but rather procedural speed timetable potential distortions or undesirable consequences for their implementation.
First of all, I should like to inform the House that, as Mr van Hulten said, today's meeting of the College of Commissioners a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement was approved, in the context of an advisory group 'rules of conduct in the public service set up as measure 1 of the action plan on the White Paper.
Mr van Hulten has pointed this out in the course of this debate, I know again.
The main aim of the recast simplification, increasing transparency, the strengthening of budgetary principles, which in practice means less exemptions, special arrangements incomprehensible, and it means increasing the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure.
It is simply very unprofitable for the Commission when treaties are going to cost X 20% will be replaced Y costs will be replaced by 30%, and often Kleinstbeträgen evidence collected and examined.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the European Union's relations with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission in this relationship [2000/2051(INI)].
These aspects particularly affect the NGOs.
Of course, this is not enough, but we should at least excessive representations from the weakness of our development aid to protect.
This is, in fact, something we come back, because it is a sensible framework.
Mr President, I am now returned from Mozambique, where the European Union following the tsunami excellent humanitarian aid, but once again Wiederaufbau-Projekte the money already raised delayed, because not all signatures collected in Brussels.
Faced with this reality, a greater commitment and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment are crucial.
We now have a harmonised system for the preparation of country strategy papers and indicative programmes for cooperation in all developing countries.
Furthermore, provided the creation of SEM do not resolve the remaining imbalance of eight bloated Verwaltungskörpern.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have attached particular importance today in this debate on the first package on maritime transport in the European Parliament, because you are dealing with three important texts, the first essential step in this area which, unfortunately, by recent events so much in the spotlight issue.
That would be from the point of view of the presidency of the Council the opportunity to discuss with the Member States on the basis of your proposals to reach an agreement in the Council, and the text at first reading, if necessary, to adopt qualified majority.
This swift and effective action, which result in two Erika packages and six proposals has caused a huge momentum.
The lesson to be drawn from this House this morning, must draw the recognition that the Law of the Sea in the world is a shameful situation and it is time that we get this right.
On substandard ships must be a clear signal that we go in European waters or in European ports cannot tolerate.
On board tankers lower tonnage, we have a compromise between 5 000 tonnes of sustainability, the limit of the IMO and 600 tonnes of sustainability, the ceiling proposed by the Commission entered into.
This information must, the European public and the port authorities and the public interest available.
The grenzenübergreifende nature of the marine environment, the pollution of an area of greater region’s widespread calls for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental pollution.
In cooperation at local level Environmental involved.
The amendment of the directive in terms of stricter application of harmonised legislation, particularly as regards the selection of embody vessels and the scope of the various Überprüfungsformen is good.
I would like to point out that the urgency you now urge you not to.
I believe that the limit for classification societies between the Council and Parliament will have to be considered new, regardless of what is being decided today.
A tachograph, a black list, with all these things, we fully agree but I would like to mention a few points to your attention.
In the light of this disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport, Europe has the challenge and eleven months after the wreck of the Erika, the European Union will be able to show a procedure that has been sorted out as rapidly as none before.
It see to what extent the liberal logic runs counter to a high level of safety at sea.
What technical measures are always taken a major source of uncertainty will remain, while in the area of the English Channel and the North Atlantic, the exponential growth of transport because of the ``economization does not stop the North Sea ports.
The President-in-Office of the Council, it would be good to face if it in his country would create order.
Mr President, since the break-up of the Erika Tankschiffs political pressure on a package of measures for the safety of vessels to improve maritime safety.
Greek ships were simply, without the area there was a storm, Mr Gayssot.
Thirdly, when we talk about these issues to be clearly between our stocks, on the one hand, and the fact that we are still use fossil fuels, no link.
We should finally have the political courage to our environmental ambitions to impose.
This means that, in this area, we have a very great responsibility and, as I see it, any institutional Eigenliebe aside.
For Finland, for example, it is essential that Russia is involved in this agreement.
This applies both to the stringent requirements for the construction of oil tankers, better rules on port state control and stricter rules for classification societies, which are also a result.
Mr President, today we are talking about maritime safety at sea, based on three reports, on which I congratulate the rapporteurs must.
As regards the three new proposals on safety at sea is concerned, there is an urgent need, in my view, the rapporteur deserves to be congratulated, you have very recently demonstrated that our Parliament is determined to new measures to increase maritime safety, strengthening controls and tighten up the design standard to adopt and future disasters cannot be accepted.
Madam President, high level series of disasters, especially oil tankers, recently severely hit our continent.
More than 80% of accidents are caused by human error, but human failure there is social nature.
Someone spoke of 'traceability'.
The directive on port state control monitors compliance with international standards and not introduce new rules.
Amendment No 18 port state control will rest periods for seafarers to put relations. implementation of the provisions on seafarers' hours of work, however, by the existing directive 99/95 covered.
I am pleased to see that the rapporteur in Amendment No 21 is a reference to the system for assessing the conditions introduced, and we have proposed thrust agreement, but rather work needs to be done in the wording of the whole clearer.
Amendment No 4 and 'point K' concerning real part of Amendment No 18 is not acceptable.
I can assure you that shipowners, ship such flags to register that intends to his intention when our proposal in force, should review.
The Commissioner has spoken 18 minutes, and in that time dozens and dozens of articles quoted and reflect the position of the Commission.
Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision on a series of measures on the trans-European network for the collection and dissemination of producing statistics inside and extra-Community goods (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201(CNS (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy)
By so I am withdrawing the motion for a resolution, I would like, however, to the conviction that our Parliament in its vote would be better heard, when it comes to the meeting of the European Council of Nice a specific and specific motion for a resolution on the important and difficult questions of the Intergovernmental Conference would rather than in the context of a single, all the other items on the agenda of the summit comprehensive resolution to deal with.
(Because more than 12 Members were opposed from their seats, the oral amendment was not taken into consideration) (Parliament adopted the resolution.
the report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the European Union's relations with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission in this relationship [2000/2051(INI))
I have as a sign of protest done because the European Union in this area are still unable to intervene in the way it really should.
Although not the proposal to amend the existing directive on port state control the Watts report actually meet the demands contained some in the right direction, forward-looking aspects of this, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.
It is therefore regrettable that the Commission proposal does not take up the idea of a genuine European Küstenüberwachungsbehörde the model of the United States existing coast guards' set up.
Unabdingbare prerequisite for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment, the fight against the unaccountability of shipowners, tough measures to control the state of vessels, the harsh punishment of Schiffsgesellschaften violate the safety rules, the improvement of working conditions for seafarers, their specific training and composition of the occupation in such a way that they increased requirements for ships can be.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur makes Mr Hatzidakis the opposite.
The Erika disaster in December 1999 has raised the question of safety at sea on the political agenda of the Community, and the Commission has these texts on which we are now, almost a year after the terrible accident, have voted prodding proposed by the European Parliament.
The current compensation funds are adequately resourced, all too clearly the Braer disaster, the Shetland industry for their losses are not adequately compensated.
Madam President, I had already mentioned, I used to sea results I am.
The proposals made by the rapporteur, harmonisation aimed at European level, can only be positive.
The relevant area is very important, as it concerns Schiffsklassifikationsgesellschaften.
That would be a great success rather than on the eve of enlargement, we do not need a rigid supranational Europe, hierarchy and far away, but a flexible, close to the peoples of Europe, based on respect for national democracies.
The public more and more contentious power struggle between obscures many Member States to look at possible compromises.
In Nice, the most important task is to ensure that the EU institutions work effectively.
Personally, I see the week’s summit encouraging contrary!
I am not an automatic link between qualified majority voting and codecision, and I believe that any decision to extend the power of codecision must be determined on a case-by-case.
The amendment of Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would qualified majority voting in the Council currently applicable to the trade in other sectors, such as public services, intellectual property, health or education extended.
This depriving the European Parliament of the right to influence is keeping quiet and silent in deference to the Parteilichkeiten national responsibility and the governments and forgetting its responsibilities to the citizens.
Furthermore, I have voted against a text that the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty, which was adopted in Nice.
It is a mistake for the European Union in two classes share this, I cannot support the fact that a third of the Member States is advancing at an even faster pace.
Its new role marked the end of the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Austria, Finland and Sweden.
In this report there is much that the British Conservatives cannot give their support. applies in particular to the emphasis placed on the enlargement of the European Union.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the implementation of a common European security and defence policy.
But against the peoples of the European Union, the new military expenditure, the report certainly have to finance and does not even guarantee that these forces are not one day in the name of "maintaining order 'is being used against itself.
Just as serious is the proposal that a state responsibility does not wish to participate, obliged to make a financial contribution to the countries involved in this war is shared out.
In military outside no solution, because they are not repair the cause of conflict or bring about a shift in public opinion.
The fact that military operations from the Community budget and the Member States have a financial contribution for these tasks should do, even if they do not wish to participate (paragraph 49 and 50).
On the other hand, it would be a good thing for the EU to face if they are to reverse the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and more humanitarian and civilian them would focus.
I support this report by my colleague, Mrs Theorin Maj-Britt.
But the needs of this group only put forward the requirement for tax 'n) admissibility Haushaltsdienstleistungen "and" adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities to make individuals'.
It is truly incredible that we, in the twenty-first century should recommend that the Member States domestic workers right to adequate social security and pensions should be guaranteed.
For many young people threatens undeclared work, the first contact with the labour market.
The worst thing is that, if women from distant countries, which inevitably adopted this work and have no other way of seeing their survival.
The reform of the Commission will be judged according to their results, hence the need for regular Sachstandsberichte the Commission during the Programmdauer and the importance of December 2002 expects full assessment.
Recently, there was a result of various scandals and weaknesses in March 1999, the resignation of the European Commission.
Finally, I think it is absolutely necessary to point out that we are the future of essential reforms at the same time, greater consistency and transparency in the Commission in its day-to-day administration, but also a greater responsibility for its part under strict limitation of the powers conferred expected.
The Conservatives support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report, to ensure democratic control and the system of three pillars function is.
(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)
We have obtained information - and let me add this immediately, I do not believe, acting as the Council and the President of France tomorrow, only 30 minutes to speak.
That is why I would like to conclude I detailed and reasoned opinion.
We should certainly vote, and I personally am in favour of a resolution, as Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others have suggested.
On these texts have been worked until night here, as the number Stimmenaufteilung in the Council, and the redistribution of seats in the European Parliament applies.
Madam President, I would like to strongly urge that the de Roo report cannot be removed from the agenda, because it is very well prepared. At the last Environment Council during the French Presidency on Monday and Tuesday next on this matter a common position produced.
Thank you very much, Mr Parish.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, its chairman, it smoke often.
The political basis is clear: harmonising the market, taking account of a high level of consumer protection health and, based on existing legislation and new scientific knowledge.
It is about their living conditions and beliefs of health protection become ever more important.
This rule no leisure consumption, but not dangerous drugs are applied, if no other than the drugs konsumierenden person affected.
Yesterday we have had in the United States against multinational tobacco procedures with a conviction because poisoning and false information about the harmlessness of products at the end.
With regard to the cigarettes in the EU are banned for health reasons, but are exported from the European Union, we feel that the end of these exports, the only thing and Consistent.
Instead of the lessons from the failure of 9 October this year to go to Luxembourg, we are still in a position, which is not legally tenable.
I have listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said to Mr Hume: 'No massive job losses in this sector.
Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and, among other things, to examine appropriate legal base.
I do not believe that a narrow path must, for whatever the content, substantial, as Mr Maaten and others showing the risk that Parliament, the Council and the European institutions in their entirety, provided that this Parliament and the Council on the chairmen of the political groups of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi proposed accept a restrictive interpretation of the legislative work of the Community institutions, which are so important for the development of Community law, hands and feet tied.
Its weakness is the emphasis on the promotion of free competition.
To conclude: since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power to questions of environmental and consumer protection coordination, and in this respect, of course, in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission must work together.
In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the decision of the Court had just as well as a ban on the advertising of alcohol off or a ban on chocolate, because, as you know, sugar is harmful.
I do not understand that a majority in this House more generous wishes to introduce Exportvorschriften as national governments is, those governments which represent many sectors referred to.
It is proven that 80% of smokers want to stop the tobacco industry few strategies to offer to help these people.
If we insist on other countries which impose standards should set by our sensible proposals to extend the internal market for exports, we all the excellent work carried out by Mr Maaten in question.
We support the implementation of the tests in a country akkreditiertes Testlabor throughout the European Union recognised standardised method.
The effects of tobacco on health are now widely accepted and legislators and public almost concluded that it is time to strict rules and regulations to adopt this product.
Community rules for this reason fully fit in the future international rules and, therefore, the risk of the birth of barriers Avert, at the same time strengthen consumer protection and guarantee a high level of public health.
On the contrary, it should wait until the whole question of additives in the Commission's first report.
As regards laboratory tests, the amendment on the approval of tests superfluous, since another article stipulates that only those products must be brought into circulation, the provisions of the directive meet.
Madam President, this report is very clear: In the present situation, the duration of directives on summer-time in each limit for five years, then it must be renewed by Parliament to extend.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer-time arrangements, which we are examining today, I think that this is a good proposal.
I therefore believe that we in this House here should not dwell too long, but the Member States and the people of the summer-time arrangements have been widely accepted and as part of our regenerates acknowledged.
I am in favour of the questions relating to the time zones and the harmonisation of summer-time, as proposed, to remain in the decision-making powers of the Member States.
There is more in favour of summer time at the end of September, some six months after its beginning to put an end to this.
We are in favour of appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the 2007 report drawn up, as mentioned in Article 5.
It made it clear that human germ line intervention cannot be accepted.
We will, if we vote in favour of this compromise, still have a regulation that ensures the therapeutic progress and the protection of patients in Europe cannot be just as it is, but improved, and that is why I would argue in favour of this compromise.
These groups must continue to fall within the scope of the directive.
I am glad, though, that we have succeeded germ put an end.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and for his efforts to bring about a compromise in view of the differences thanks.
These programmes relate to the prevention of cancer, AIDS prevention of drug dependence and promotion. your termination would end the relevant plans and the work of the networks created means.
It is very fortunate that the land in advance to prepare for us to move forward as quickly as possible and, even if a second reading is needed, as far as possible approaching the time when a decision can be taken.
Furthermore, we must bear in mind that both the promotion and prevention and monitoring are increasingly important, and that is why they need more important zugemessen and a higher budget earmarked for this purpose.
Madam President, During the Trakatellis report on the extension of the current European action programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which European policy in the field of public health moves.
I know that the Council has given its consent principle.
In the European Union, there is now the paradox that the borders for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital was abolished, EUR 15 limits, however, continue in the areas of police and justice in criminal matters maintained, your Eliminate will make it more difficult for the Member States.
Finally, it must be said that the initiative is a real and important step forward in the creation of a European criminal, which if it only covers elements and their impact is limited to the real needs a great many European citizens, yet virtually powerless as if they were outside the territory of their country of residence victim of a crime.
What we have asked for these people?
At the same time, ensure that professionals direct contacts with the victims exercise to receive special training.
The victims must not be victims twice over, only victims of crime and the system.
In this context, it is also important that the members of the family of the victim discreetly and professional knowledge of the facts and, if wanted the necessary support can be expected and that they are not all of the press must be.
This is the case, irrespective of the type of crime.
We must not at national level or at European level ever moved the fundamental principle that an individual is always responsible for their own actions must bear.
In other cases, it may be necessary to provide information needed in a language nature of the European Union, which is not their own.
I welcome the favourable response from the European Parliament on this first text on such an important issue, so that the area of freedom, security and justice, which we have just set up our fellow citizens protection offered in situations often only with difficulty easily.
vote on urgent procedure
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
We have in the night of 23 to 24 November with the Council on points of budget agreed, certainly not splendour, but makes sense.
The Commission was about a revision proposed EUR 300 million. Council - fought it tooth and nail.
However, I know from conversations that much more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council’s to obtain a mandate and pure national self-interest in a reasonably sensible and workable pan-European decision as a result.
I hope that the work on a common recruitment Office as Neudeutsch means European recruitment and make real progress for the problems in the next few years in store for all institutions - the Council, like the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - the need for crew in the coming years to deal with together.
The Council has denied this revision, we should now actually data, and I would like to warn him as a preventive measure: flexibility instrument in two consecutive years, is in fact less than 15 months and the first less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspective - to take weakens the flexibility instrument financially, since it prevents its restoration and possible accumulation by EUR 600 million is required.
This is a considerable amount of high needs in 2001 due, in particular, by the use of the flexibility instrument of EUR 200 million is to be funded.
Bearing in mind the new facts, the Council in second reading, adopted a budget increase to 2.5% characteristics.
Before you finally adopt this budget, I would like to emphasise what value the Council to respect certain basic budgetary rules on the recruitment of funds in the reserve, the legal basis and the division of expenditure sets.
And, in contrast to Nice, I believe that all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, with the outcome in the end reasonably satisfied.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, are again finding BSE-erkrankten cattle made in the budget immediate action is needed in the protection of human health, consumer protection, but also in terms of aid for farmers affected by this situation.
Moreover, the Council has for the framework programme for reconstruction in the Balkans Mehrjahresbetrag set only a benchmark, but with the financial perspectives in line.
hanging puffing and we still have a few million euros more PROGRESS’.
My sincere thanks to Mrs Haug.
Remember, therefore, that this 1% of the budget of the European Union are used very well.
If I have understood you correctly, you said that we should not use the reserve, which is contrary to the rules.
I therefore believe that we, along with many others, I am due to the fact that time is short cannot mention, very good things.
While agricultural expenditure, almost half of the entire budget represent, taking into account the Letter of Amendment in the coming year 5% grow, the growth of the entire budget only 3.5%.
We now see a great risk that in the next few years, the conflict between MEDA and Mittelmeeranrainerstaat-Projekten Balkans increase, although we all know that it is precisely money there is urgently needed.
overcome the difficulties towards the aim auftürmten Helsinki commitments to the candidate countries to comply without fall outside the European Union and the future to enable Europe, progress will continue to act effectively.
However, progress has been made real progress, even if they do not go as far as the presidency, which I would like to say, national considerable openness shown - would have liked.
For the statute for European political parties is provided for a new legal basis, and that Parliament receives the right of complaint, in accordance with Article 230 of the Treaty.
In recent months, three important steps forward have been done.
This is the aim of the Nice Declaration in this respect and consideration launched to combat doping coordination at European level.
Among the threats, as everyone knows, global warming.
In Nice, the European Union continues to the provision for the leadership and a common foreign and security policy necessary permanent bodies set up, a Political and Sicherheitspolisches committee, a military committee and a European Defence Staff.
For this cooperation, for your support and for the reception given thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Now we need to make the text Parliament’s scrutiny.
I would point out in passing, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the cost will be borne by the taxpayers.
I see it as a failure, not just in relation to the European Union 's declared ambition to change the institutions and to improve the efficiency of the European Union to the new members include properly, but also in relation to another important objective, which is perhaps too pointed out, in relation to the rapprochement between the European Union and the citizens.
The right questions we believe that those impressive crowd occupied, on the eve of the summit from all over Europe in Nice zusammengeströmt.
First of all, the Fifteen rush tränengasgeschwängerten Grundrechtecharte atmospherics signed.
(Applause)
My group is disappointed by the Treaty and the future that it brings concerned this, we will best fight against.
Mr President, you have the floor.
Finally, I would like to respond to Mr Hager, the instrument of enhanced cooperation, I think that it is useful for Europe to make dynamic and looking at the way in which it just now, I believe, Mr Prodi has already said. I support it fully.
Mr President, I would like to know whether the jurisdiction of the European Parliament for a new achievement of summer time after Nice.
The so far by the complexity of clinical trials abgeschreckten pharmaceutical companies will perhaps by the Member States, as well as our Parliament clearly expressed wishes to encourage the market to develop paediatric medicines, even if this is not large enough to secure the profitability of investment.
. - (FR) Should the summer-time regime, the time of the oil crisis, in saving energy is to be introduced and extended to 2001, continue?
It is not always the status of victims in criminal proceedings protected effectively.
This European initiative so many passengers and holidaymakers benefit.
Mr President, first of all I should like to greet Mr Prodi, who is here with us, and the Presidency has just enter the Chamber and stress that this House has probably never been such unanimity in evaluating the results of a summit showed.
Europe is moving forward, that is, under the French Presidency, in six months, as I see it, in spite of everything, his work in six key areas has done.
Above all, however, I am afraid that the United Kingdom, France and Germany now will be able over decades between states of different sizes and between the institutions reached sensitive balance.
It is difficult to see how far the Nice decisions actually enlargement of the EU easier.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.
For all that, I can only draw the necessary conclusions, that this Treaty of Nice voted 'no' vote will be.
Mr President, the most important result of the Treaty of Nice, despite everything, a treaty that has come about and room for the candidate countries can be created.
The real winners of this conference, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, the saying 'no' to Europe.
So we forget Nice and we are turning our eyes on post-Nice process. Allow me hope for the Belgian Presidency to its plan announced by a large Convention’s put, since it has proved: we need new ways to go, we need a new method, we must speed up the story, because 2004 is too late, far from being a reality, brings many risks.
Instead, there was the spirit of Nice appears to be asking how we can block, such as intergouvernementalisieren therefore home as a defender of national interests to celebrate, rather than to ensure that the European Union really is advancing.
What we are after Amsterdam and Nice, a Europe of potentates, a Europe of national administrations and not the Europe of the political agreement.
In the key issues, we can stop to qualified majority voting to give up.
It is true that, I do not agree with the words of Mr Bayrou, since I sit here this morning, first on the side of the President of the Republic, is now in our own cause and everyone’s flying moderate criticisms, friendly criticism, as I see it, but in any case criticism.
We must not forget that it is in fact the first time since 1957, this scheme actually reformed or changed.
We have constitutional systems and therefore the competences cannot be mixed.
Thank you, Minister.
But it is not in the Treaties, there is a reference to the Charter in Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union.
Let me conclude by saying that were mentioned some positive aspects, such as the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and the Statute, the right of Parliament to the other institutions in the Court of Justice, an important factor of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, the inclusion of the so-called 'Lex Prodi’s' in the Treaty, strengthening the president and the new composition of the Commission. These is a reasonable compromise, which I accept and which will certainly be put to the test.
Mr President, we already have an uncompromising assessment of what happened in Nice.
If we look at the issues: the Charter has not been incorporated into the Treaties, not even a reference.
We want the Heads of State and Government demonstrate that we can do better.
Despite the Eigenlobs the French presidency this morning, the Intergovernmental Conference is not brought to a good conclusion.
Mr President, it is not easy now to criticise the French Presidency, since he is not here.
Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model of the IGC defunct.
2001 budget (continuation)
This does not mean, however, that it would not be more and not much better.
These ceilings, the Commission will be obliged, in the context of a restrictive budget priorities, as every authority must do.
In this debate vote following a long and difficult process of decision-making on the budget of the European Union for the year 2001 at the end.
That is why we have proceeded as follows: With recourse to Article 272, we have avoided a budgetary crisis. the Financial Perspective, despite the use of the flexibility instrument will be maintained.
At the Council addressed, I should like to say that we do not play as quickly as our basis the balls and that we play until we achieved the desired result.
We do not want the resolution Mr Colom already underway for the coming year contains, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share his criticism that a solution can be found in the financial Unterausstattung category 4 in this way the multiannual nature of the major objectives of the Union's external policies and the definition of the Financial Perspective distorted.
In order to achieve all our long-term undertakings must in future be priorities.
That is the money which our fellow citizens are available and properly spent well.
If we expected supplementary budget, they will provide for almost 8%, while we in all the other areas, whether it is education policy, the whole area of internal policy, including research, foreign policy, the administration of pre-accession aid, a total of only a growth rate of 1.1%.
As the cooperation as well, we in the supplementary and amending budget in January the opportunity to pursue it.
Equally, we welcome it if not yet regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic States criticism.
It was with great interest that social and political developments in Russia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.
Even if President Putin, we have to guarantee democracy in his country, he does not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russia. It is still the democratic legal order not to spread a reality in Russia.
However, we should not secretly, rather a Europe of economic cooperation to build.
As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden is quite right.
Who Russia considers external and individual direct evidence from the country itself and Russian partners get quick in danger of selective the reality of the country to explain what, in fact, Russland-Bild fit.
In the political field, the common strategy proposes Russia, a permanent dialogue on politics and security arena and to establish a permanent mechanism.
I would like to stress that we really have to make it clear that Russia is actually a political union with Belarus is concerned.
Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support such a project?
As the honourable Members know, the last summit between the European Union and Russia Mr Prodi a broader dialogue on energy issues set in motion.
I very much hope that I am at the beginning of next year will have the opportunity themselves to visit Kaliningrad, and not only because Immanuel Kant throughout their lives has spent there.
I would like to congratulate the honourable Member once again on an excellent report on a very important subject, which we in the coming years in this House will certainly address repeatedly.
You put me in a very difficult situation.
Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is extremely necessary, since the BSE crisis has huge implications for animal feed production and imports of animal feed.
The Council during his many meetings with Russia at all levels expressed its concerns, in particular to encourage the Russian Government, excessive use of force and to avoid possible extension of the conflict, effective and independent investigation of human rights violations, the OSCE support group in the fulfilment of its mission aid and, finally, the promotion of humanitarian aid to provide.
Mr President, Mr President, on a point of order, it is customary in this House for the various oral questions cannot be adequately answered in writing, tabled subsequently.
(Interruption from Mr Posselt)
This directive dates from 1992.
And in this sense, we have to work.
These groups are, however, do not appear in the new proposal was included.
The presidency and some Member States have association of the European sugar industry have already been letters to the Commission's proposal to maintain take them into account in its deliberations.
Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):
First of all, I must say that the President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question by Mr Korakas has not answered.
Now we need to set up this authority, and I believe that the European authorities of the problem very well aware, and that we must make progress.
To put it in a nutshell, the representative of the Presidency, therefore, in this case the French ambassador in Algeria, Mr Ahmed M. Taleb met?
We welcome in this context the preparatory proposed and approved by the General Assembly of the provisions of the accreditation non-governmental organisations preparations and to the special session in September 2001.
The text of the partnership agreement contains a number of references to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
As the Council with regard to the honourable Member mentioned in his last answer, the process of mutual recognition of decisions taken in criminal matters better protection of the rights of individuals permit.
However, I would like to follow this up.
In particular, it adopts the political control and strategic leadership of military use of crisis management.
I would just like to point out that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxation, the harmonisation of the establishment and the functioning of the internal market, it is necessary, in Article 93, and harmonisation, in accordance with Article 94, those rules directly to the establishment and the functioning of the common market effect, direct taxation.
I would like to make a few words to say that these three key areas.
If the behavior any doubt against any fighting, could the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, based on a regional cooperation, go beyond.
We need, at the end of the day, cooperation with Yugoslavia and mutual cooperation.
Mr President, Our Group supports the work of Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the negotiation of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia.
Mr President, the years I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity of many Croatians in their efforts to monitor freedom and prosperity, like other peoples of our continent, with its integration into the European institutions gleichsetzten.
On the basis of Croatia’s development of this year, I am convinced that we should be able to submit a straffes pace, because that Croatia has done in recent months.
That is certainly the approach and the speed with which we in the last few months developments in Croatia stopped confirmed.
We are the people guilty in Croatia, and its government support fully in the years to come, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that it recommends continue along the path chosen.
In this context, it is incomprehensible that, in the spring of this year, thousands of supporters of the Laskar Jihad in the Moluccas have been able to draw fueling conflicts there.
East Timor militia to deny the return of refugees and workers threatened.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should just like to mention three points.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by Mrs Maij-Weggen, Weggen congratulate on her excellent work.
It is no exception.
Continuing violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya great suffering on the people.
Tomorrow the formal Sakharov prizes to be held.
In view of recent reports from the Indonesian archipelago is short, however, concerns the question of whether the situation is not serious, President Wahid and its allies even more precarious, as described by the rapporteur.
If we want to help Indonesia, we must now with money and action. words are not enough.
In my opinion, the report makes this point very important explanations.
It is clear that the country’s difficulties do not happen overnight to overcome.
Protection of the Community's financial interests
The obstacles to its independent work, especially in the Personalrekrutierung and its structured building must finally be removed.
The Commission must therefore be an internal reform process finally want to take advantage of their announcement that fraud will not be tolerated and any systematic pursuit of fraud.
I believe that it must be the consequence of Nice.
We welcome the negotiations between the Member States on the approximation of laws in the area of crime, but we would like our countries have no federal EU-Anklagebehörde suggest.
In addition, I should like to know why the publication of the document from the Commission on this subject until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro has been delayed.
I have requested that these countries naming, because I believe it is time to denounce.
I am actually sure that particularly OLAF is interested in the choice of higher managers to make transparent.
We must ensure, however, that we all focusing on the Commission's problems are not our own, but rather overlooked considerable problems we also have problems.
We are trying to extinguish the fire and nip in the smoke.
No one can understand that I do not.
In order to ensure that this objective is achieved any relationship, I would like to respond to four questions which I believe is a crucial role in the work of the authority on budgetary control authority play.
Parliament itself is the problem with the Treaty.
It is true alarming if the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties on respect for the rights of Members explicitly attention must be drawn.
It has the opportunity for a certain period of time is not a routine on the budget lines in question to approve, in particular those of the increase in the resources allocated in the budget designed to further investigations have been completed, and could even call on the President of the Commission, the resignation of Commissioners to demand that the environment has been noted serious problems - a kind of EU-Kaiserschnitt.
The report calls for detailed inventories of operational activities, thorough inspections of budget lines and irregularities and internal Commission evaluation of performance.
Mr President, Commissioner, the starting point for the transmission of information to the European Parliament of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and not the interinstitutional agreement.
The result of this common position, however, it would be if he would not change, we will end up not only in relation to North America is not a level playing field, but not in Europe.
I do not know why it does not succeed, as all the other directives have been able, at the end of a compromise.
It is a proposal which is a long and, I fear, stormy journey, some of the current difficulties to be overcome.
The first amendment relates to Article 4, which is the competent authority to supply will be regulated.
On the other hand, would the proposal now before us create confusion and find the best each jurisdiction and potential legal actions during the adoption of a firm cause very sensitive time.
In the United Kingdom, the acquisition of Übernahmeausschuss prescribed voluntary code of conduct proved, and is a good example of how a very complex matter legislation less well suited to be dealt with in a pragmatic way.
Far more important, however, that we should thus be able to function, as set out in Lisbon, the creation of a competitive and dynamic European economy is advancing.
It is for us in the European Parliament, about the great Spannungsfelder takeovers law, for example, the Bureau Versus shareholders, major shareholders Versus minority shareholders, companies Versus capitalized minimum European regulated.
With some of the amendments tabled by Parliament, the text of the common position of the Council, by improved points which could lead to difficulties in interpretation referred and calling for speedier implementation of the directive.
It is certainly not to see that the proposed definition of adequate price is better than another, because the various currently in the Member States definitions are all quite explicit.
The debate is closed.
Furthermore, the artist Auskunftsrecht given its ambitions within a period of up to three years professional dealers to know what is useful, because they are buying and sales accounts should be kept.
Consequently, the Austrian Legislatures asked, and not the European legislator to attack the only artists and auction houses creates positive framework.
Furthermore, the issue we are dealing with the need for a common position all the greater, because only such makes it possible for the European Union to international firmly ensure that the interests of artists to be protected throughout the world.
I trust in the wisdom and foresight in this House.
That benefited Germany in 1998 only 274 of 7 000 artists, who had delegated their rights of resale rights, with 40% of the amount of administrative and gathering got.
In short, there is no need for harmonisation in this field.
A similar amendment has already been rejected at first reading.
It is assumed that the translations despite this very busy and difficult timetable can be submitted ex-post.
Only, we have now reached the stage where, unfortunately, we cannot put off.
We have proposed in committee, a year earlier.
Of course, this Parliament will support the values and will continue to defend.
As a result of the technological developments and changes in the markets will inevitably changes take place.
Since we cannot Rechtsgrund exclude competition.
Reducing the core of the postal sector, in other words the universal service, the transport of letters to a weight of 50 grammes would national postal services seriously invoke the danger, no universal service at a reasonable price for the entire population in all the regions more guarantee.
I am referring to my Conservative colleagues in this Parliament, to remind the mess in the United Kingdom anrichteten than the British Post Office wanted to privatise.
The safety net for the postal services we have Hängematte these large companies postal services alone and will continue to do what they continue to be permitted.
With this result, I am very pleased, because the concept of special services, the new technologies from the area of universal service was going to leave.
Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot and will not tolerate.
The Commission therefore proposes the second stage not the complete liberalisation of postal services.
This is a future, I would like to ask for other countries in the European Union.
Mr Bolkestein has recently in the Dutch press the French accused of an illiberal approach, at least one article title.
In this regard, Spain could say something about this fund should be set up and used, it could be the uncertain legal bases of the Fund, virtual criteria, its composition and the discretionary express its application.
We will vote tomorrow, I hope, for the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or Mr Sterckx, otherwise I see led me to vote for the report.
Royal Mail is involved in this competition and distributed my letters in Malmö, Sweden.
What we have from the debate or learned from the controversy, Commissioner, with its monitoring of liberalisation of postal services for lack of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down in this directive has generated? we have learned that, under the guise of progressive and aufwertender concepts, such as modernisation, liberalisation or support technological recovery, reducing the social quality of a country cannot hide.
The planned protection of universal service by setting up a compensation fund, private operators contributions to finance the Universaldienstpflichten Postanbieter do in remote areas, is not being upheld.
These shortcomings and this delay contributed to the debate purpose and resources are often confused.
Madam President, with regard to this matter, we are talking about economic and social cohesion.
Madam President, allow me first of all, as the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to congratulate, because of course it has carried out a complex, difficult work he has had to try to reconcile different proposals, attitudes and place of departure and targets.
I am afraid that the result will be that the current monopolies its position at the taxpayers' expense further consolidate and set new ones slightly higher.
I am pleased that our liberal party from other European countries, the position of the British Liberals support.
I believe that the liberalisation would be desirable and I welcome the benefits for consumers who derive from it.
One justified, because it is the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, part of the completion of the internal market the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment in the forefront.
The provision of such a service forms the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and all our activities to improve the service aimed.
The special services are another important area, encourage innovation and modernisation must be driven forward.
He said that continue to believe that it is virtually opening up the postal market by the end of this decade inevitable.
I support the obligation to provide a universal service absolutely established and guaranteed in future.
For this reason, I cannot and will not stand idly by when the future of this sector at stake, because we are the tasks that we all have been transferred in Lisbon, not properly.
Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.
However, I would like to remind you that the main objective of this common organisation of the market their products, a network for the Community market.
I am pleased that we have made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ultimately achieve unanimity. I should like to thank my colleagues, and Mr Fernández Martín, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their support.
For example, we must continue our concern for banana production in certain ACP countries, small producer countries in the West Indies and in some countries in West Africa, the traditional suppliers in the banana market and to whom we have obligations, we must not forget that.
That is why I would ask that this report in its entirety, just as in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Members of this Parliament will support it.
From the United States historical reference was originally rejected in the meantime, however, a solution with its own historical Referenzzeiträumen supported.
Strong interests, especially the Americans themselves are not banana producers, but the American capital invested in businesses play a role.
Sometimes it seems that the Commission is in the proposals on deregulation in trade and agricultural production international even further away than the Cairns Group.
Unfortunately, maintain the Commission and the Council to resolve the production seriously endanger, especially after 2006.
In the various WTO findings does not mean that we are going to our traditional suppliers should not give preferential tariff arrangements.
The transitional period should therefore about fifteen years, but at least 10 years, and the compensatory payments must income support for European producers and paragraph of production in the outermost regions as well, which therefore help the institutions includes those who produce bananas marketed.
I hope that it sounds now our arguments, because the system proposed by the Commission of the tariff preferences, although it is fixed at EUR 300 could in fact be rather ineffective because the ACP producers by the so-called served sidelined.
Votes
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.
Before the vote:
(Parliament approved the oral amendment)
the report (A5-0383/2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the EU’s and -instanzen (2000/2008(INI)]
Most smokers are not full risk on the consequences of their doing clear.
It is on this basis that I, in my long parliamentary life of 35 years now always kept.
However, I fear that this hope is pointless.
That is our last attempt, by means of labels and photographs on cigarette packs to demonstrate the real consequences of smoking.
Lehne report (A5-0368/2000)
This is an assessment, as relevant and properly, and it is I therefore voted against the report in its entirety.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was quite right when he rejected the maximum and minimum insistence, not less than 7% must be.
In its vote against this directive, my group would like to signify a political put in so far as we in the European Union must not so as to stop unnecessary provisions.
Of course, the one-time must be condemned Stalinist dictatorship, but how can Mr Putin just any confidence, the murderers of the Chechen people, the sponsors of various mafias Head of State, any opposition and civil society, trade unions and political parties) would eliminate to strengthen its own power?
In fact, Indonesia would intensify these relations are not particularly deserve, because in the last few years, the leaders of the country is not exactly a high level of democracy and great credit is excellent, but we must also Indonesian citizens in mind, why we have this intensification of relations and welcome this aid.
This unit can only deal with crimes committed by pupils.
. - (FR) The Theato report on the fight against fraud will enable us to the statement that the European Central Bank is certainly better proof of its famous independence, accession to the agreement on the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is not appropriate.
That concludes the vote.
We have to recognise that there are only two options: either we include, we are not included.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have no reason to change of title.
Simply customs system is an important element for the balance of the Commission proposal and provides an important basis, so that we could make progress within the Council.
Measures for the marketing of these bananas also national and regional programmes for promoting the development of rural areas.
Europe and the United States are working in defence of our common values together.
We shall probably a new WTO round and the effects of the many new bilateral trade-related talk about this round is currently being discussed in the US hemisphere.
He pointed out that the transatlantic relationship over the last ten years has been considerably extended and American side, in particular, the efforts made by President Clinton is due, but I believe that in the history books someday noted that these new relations between Europe and the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and the transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995, made a significant contribution to the success of this relationship play a key role was.
So, it is important to carry out a change of tack and indeed transatlantic agenda for the year 2001 to write.
I would like to conclude by the statement from the Dominican Republic quote: "The WTO’s initially impartial arbitration service, which ensures that the common rules are complied with and that countries are familiar with the free world trade.
Secondly, we are on the decline of the Communist welcome graphic terms, but the collapse of the Soviet Union, the only superpower left, namely the United States.
I know that it is a successful and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees maintains that these issues are involved.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
These objectives, the main objective and secondary objectives will be the acid test of the specific proposals put forward by the Commission must be judged on its own merits.
As you know, such a solution could be set up, only one country, with the possibility of services throughout the Union, an avalanche in those countries with lower taxation cause.
This was allowed the standard rate of 15% cannot fall below the Member States received the right or a number of minimum rates of no less than 5% applied, with the case now planned derogations.
We asked the Commission to monitor, in order to ensure that there is no distortion of the market is submitted and that the Council and the European Parliament will be kept informed.
In short, what this proposal is correct, but the method is wrongly drawn up, if we really electronic economy in Europe want to support, it will be a VAT exemption of our own e-Unternehmen and not try to our problems are others to transfer the right signal.
In order to demands for a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases meet, we must all possible measures to limit their take.
The only case where there has not yet been any tax levied when a third country in the European Community will be delivered.
The positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be brought to an end.
Companies from third countries are not taxed.
As regards CDs are not very old-fashioned, but should be taxed, while the Internet available programmes to be exempted from tax.
However, should the solution and not technically and as a barrier to the development of the Internet-Transaktionen show that it is in the European Union, despite all the desired expansion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union toothless and lose yield.
We should be thinking up ways in which we can promote electronic commerce and no new methods thought, as it tax.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe represent the principle of 'as little state as possible' with the USA as an example.
The Primarolo has drawn up simple rules must be implemented.
The point I am in this Parliament adopted group believe that fact should be corrected papers normally benefit from lower VAT rates, while reducing the digital newspapers is not applicable.
A tax on aircraft fuel can therefore only international consensus to ensure a level playing field.
I particularly welcome the fact that the report is one of the most important to me in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism made statements underpinning this Parliament a few months ago favored, and, while there is no doubt that it is politically difficult to an international agreement on the taxation of aviation fuel, at least in the short term should examine alternative instruments to achieve the same effect, including Emissionsabgabe.
Indeed, the industry is 100% Flugsicherungsabgaben and charges for their infrastructure charges in 1998 amounted to USD 4 billion - in contrast to other modes of transport, such as rail and road transport, which is still heavily subsidised.
The current situation is harmful.
In this context, we must unfortunately note that there is a problem with the emissions from aviation, although the percentage is not so great, but it is increasing very strongly, and that is why we should not talk down.
This plan for the development of SMEs in how damaging outside the European Union, especially given the proposed reduction of the threshold value for exemption from tax on an unacceptable low level of turnover of 40 000.
If we are now in connection with the question under discussion at the overzealousness we actually endanger Europe important future of electronic commerce.
The starting point, whereby services based in a third country, the customers in the Community, provides only one point register, do not need to shift from tax revenues between Member States.
Since the discussion in the Council is still under way and, amongst other things, given the ambition of the Commission, the issue of VAT and electronic commerce in the short term to a successful conclusion, it seems to me to be the best at the moment, Parliament's amendments cannot formally accept, but to try to the discussions in the Council through as far as possible.
That is why I cannot accept the proposed amendments.
Thank you very much for you this week in all these different issues are adopted.
The Commission, for its part, only three months after the accident fulfilling its responsibility and a first package of measures adopted by the European Parliament on 30 November fully confirmed.
In fact, it is more than 15 existing directives or regulations urgently necessary to harmonise practices and greater control of the application of the Community rules, in order to implement the appearance, if necessary, unacceptable and considerable differences in the field of maritime safety in the European Union to prevent it.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her continuing commitment in the area of maritime safety.
I would like to remind the House that the air safety in the field of Europe and the United States in the field of compensation applied is not in other countries agree figures applied.
Secondly, I would like to say that the French justice, which would have the possibility of a specific funds to confiscate society or frozen for compensation for damage or to pay different establish liability would exceed the sum of the criteria of the international rules on pollution by hydrocarbons is required.
The Commission is of the opinion that these steps are a step in the right direction and create fairer Abgabensysteme incentives for a more efficient and rational use of the road network offer.
In the light of the criticism, especially from Ireland and France, this amendment, and the matter is now being given by the British Minister of Finance, a completely new initiative: you as a consumer levy for all, including British lorry drivers presented.
I am obliged to ensure that consumers have available food, whether from the European Union and outside the highest adequate.
I understand the concern of the honourable Member.
Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately I have to say that I have your answer is not enough.
The point raised by the honourable Member is very important.
Nigeria Chevron Ijaw community accused of violence against the people and even Chechnya-of Nigerian soldiers paid demonstrators at the naval base Warri to turn their guns on.
In their on 15 November adopted the report the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98/98, no solution to the problem of the Korean predatory could be found.
I believe that the intentions in its entirety is very reassuring, but reality, our shipyards are closing now.
Question No 38 by (H-0868/00):
Mr President, Commissioner, I can understand that you do not want to change its decision, although ten Member States a customs reject.
This initiative is based on a Council Regulation amending the Regulation, the current GSP establishes.
I represent several sugar beet growers, and I am therefore very concerned indeed.
This is work that is carried out in the committee rather than with this week had to be, as Mr Nielson is Balkanreise.
Now we are working on the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg arguments for discussions with its sugar beet farmers need it at any time to address.
I would like Commissioner in every respect a very good and positive response to thank.
I will raise the matter with my services when discussing the question of the budget for next year is clear.
My services and I myself are trying to the geographical distance between the parties and the future court impact limits.
Just as the courts in Düsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany specialising in law, and there is also such a specialised courts in London, should a court in the Community meeting and cases decides on the Community patent to be very specific.
In order for such a provisional situation is not underway, the Commission, in a letter of 13 July last year, the reminded Member States of their duty to national tribunals to appoint.
As the honourable Member knows, submit a complaint no impact on the progress of the project.
Question No 47 by (H-0877/00):
The Commission is therefore of the available legal remedies just laid down in the regulation sense use.
