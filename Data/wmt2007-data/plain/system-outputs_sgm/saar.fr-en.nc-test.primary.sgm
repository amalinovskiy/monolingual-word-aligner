<SEG id="1"> The House and the House of Europe </SEG> 
<SEG id="2"> The extreme right in Europe is characterised by its racism and its use of the issue of immigration in a divergence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="3"> The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, the supporters of the national front of Mr Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties and movements formed on the topic of current aversion towards immigrants and the promotion of policies simplistic to control. </SEG> 
<SEG id="4"> While the resolution as and Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (never quite soon), the question disappear from European policy in the near future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="5"> An aging population and, more and more, entail a growing racial division in the European countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="6"> The main parties from the centre left and centre right have dealt with this perspective in applying the ostrich policy against all expectations, hoping that the problem would disappear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="7"> This will not be the case, as the clearly demonstrates the history of fragmentation of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="8"> Relations with the United States have been given for decades - and have always - the front of the political scene, to the point that occupy a place as important as, if not more, as a factor of priorities and political attitudes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="9"> The first step to tackle the issue of European policy is to understand the origin and the consequences of the origin, even if this involves the discovery of discovery. </SEG> 
<SEG id="10"> This is precisely the aim pursued in large part by research teams in economic, sociology, psychology and in political science in the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="11"> This research shows that the representatives of different races are much less confidence with each other; the whites are less inclined to support the cause of social security which, according to them, do the minorities; more fragmented communities have more influence and a more important, of rates of many more students and less productive public property by the enforced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="12"> That does not mean that it is necessary to eliminate the heterogeneity and create more homogenous, but it is necessary to recognise the reality of these issues in order to begin to work of sound policies relating to public relations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="13"> Of course, the Americans question the methods to be used. </SEG> 
<SEG id="14"> Some pronounce themselves in favour of action programmes which give the policy priorities in the granting of a job, the admission to the university and public contracts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="15"> These policies are regarded as a means of can lift for the injustice of the past and, more importantly, of creating role models and to overcome the remaining discrimination and perhaps. </SEG> 
<SEG id="16"> Other protest against an affirmative action and support a policy that does not worry of race, associated with the free market and to create jobs, then to create jobs for minorities and to help families. </SEG> 
<SEG id="17"> This last point is crucial in any policy as one of the most significant causes of poverty in the United States is the broadcasting of single parents understand single mother) in the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="18"> What is the right response, the issue is that the problem of the measures to be taken regarding the represents a problem in the American policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="19"> Of course, the minorities have progressed towards more integration and economic success. </SEG> 
<SEG id="20"> In the 1950s, the black decided not to sit in front of buses, today, two of the main actors of American foreign policy are blacks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="21"> We cannot deny that the American politicians parties continue to deploy the "and" as a tool for development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="22"> Take the case of Patrick, the former assistant of Reagan is concerned, during the time of the last election. </SEG> 
<SEG id="23"> It has recently published a book entitled ‘ success of the West: dying immigrant populations, our country ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="24"> But for every book as this one, it is ten other which include a serious analysis of the question than in America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="25"> The analysis and the political debate on the relations have a considerable delay in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="26"> At the very most, the issue is examined closely in terms of immigration quotas and limitations of borders, not in terms of opportunities and of social problems created by a Europe of more and more mixed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="27"> Of course, a policy of immigration policy is required in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="28"> But we must not stop there: the price of borders and does not mean the end of American policy on the internal problems of race! </SEG> 
<SEG id="29"> Europe is rich and its population ageing quickly: the Europeans, reinforced by more generous social assistance, are no longer prepared to accept "dirty jobs', say, agriculture and the area of leather. </SEG> 
<SEG id="30"> This attitude today that the increase of immigration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="31"> The Europeans are quick to criticise the United States for the failures of their policy on minorities and for any manifestation of racism on the other side of the Atlantic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="32"> The reading of the European press often appear a complex of superiority towards the United States on the questions: they (the Americans) have problems with the racism; we are against it, with the exception of except for the similar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="33"> What happened in the course of the last few weeks, and in Amsterdam, demonstrates that the problem is in Europe is more profound and, as in the United States, because the sad truth that the racial relations are difficult and that confidence and cooperative behaviour and racial lines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="34"> If the main parties of Europe do not commit themselves more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their country and to put the "with" at the centre of their priorities, individuals such as the Pen will always try to fill the gap with their message of hatred. </SEG> 
<SEG id="35"> Fight the Presidency </SEG> 
<SEG id="36"> The attention of Europe is today tour and with the way towards enlargement and the Constitution in the course of negotiations between the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="37"> However, the result of several of the with the European Commission will be no less important to determine the fate of the new enlarged Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="38"> France has chosen unilaterally to the stability and growth Pact by giving away its public deficit beyond the limit of 3% of GDP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="39"> The French like to speak of the way that their thinking, but where Budgets are concerned, Descartes is more and confusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="40"> France was one of the main criticisms of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish government budget surplus, which was then to 4%, that of a single 0.5%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="41"> Other countries have not complied with the stability Pact, but France is the first country to do with satisfies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="42"> None of this should not come as a surprise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="43"> The fact that apply to his own very well to consider its own culture as an exception. </SEG> 
<SEG id="44"> Thus, France to any veto any reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="45"> As everyone knows, the CAP is a well offered by the rich European farmers (particularly the French farmers) that at the expense of farmers in difficulty of developing countries and of European consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="46"> France is also trying to get back to the old policies of private businesses in deficit and on the verge of collapse and on public funds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="47"> The Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, may not lose this battle: it needs the support of those who have faith in the markets and the equality of treatment for all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="48"> History is simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="49"> The French government plans to raise question, a company which has developed products of high technology, which, with the high-speed train, but which is in bankruptcy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="50"> The French government proclaims that it never will abandon its plan to rescue Alstom, a plan which has all the planned: maintaining employment, protection of investors, etc. </SEG> 
<SEG id="51"> Moreover, in question is a business of high technology, the French government playing the development of research and development, investment from the fact that the investment in R & d is beneficial to growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="52"> Save Alstom and is of course an error. </SEG> 
<SEG id="53"> The company is formed different units, some beneficial, others: it is obvious that it is necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="54"> The more profitable, such as that of the TGV, easily nature; the more deficit must be closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="55"> The part of the French taxpayers in the costs of restructuring temporary employees rather than to the life of a business that is not profitable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="56"> It is important that the European Commission does not allow the France of laws on measures for itself in the policies on competition, as it seems to be doing with the budget deficits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="57"> The Commission must condemn the public financing of private companies in France, just as she condemns the subsidies in all other European Member. </SEG> 
<SEG id="58"> The Commission has already got a success in this direction, in particular Germany to cancel the guarantees, the public banks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="59"> A particularly and France in general should not make exception and must respond to the same standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="60"> If the Commission does not act, the European Union look again at a playground for the French officials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="61"> France has already taken the head of the foreign policy of the European Union with its foreign Affairs Minister, Mr de Villepin, which acts and that more and more to a Minister of foreign Affairs of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="62"> At the same time, the France of regulations to common economic policy and aid policy for private companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="63"> The European Commission lose credibility that it remains to finish by like a Parisian of lesser importance? </SEG> 
<SEG id="64"> Waste on the question of the Alstom Group would have serious repercussions in Europe and not only for the policies on competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="65"> The war for oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="66"> For decades, both for that will pursue the same objectives in the field of oil: support so that it can be done during the stability of oil, to reduce the internal consumption, reduce the dependence on imports and related to diversify the sources of supply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="67"> Despite the appearances, these objectives are always the same today, under the Bush administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="68"> Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, has chosen a different route. </SEG> 
<SEG id="69"> A substantial increase in the production of probably the dependence on the USA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="70"> The price of a barrel of oil will without doubt with the emergence of a new source of supply, where a source of us, notably in relation to the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="71"> It is paradoxical that the USA and control of Iraqi oil in the framework of the programme "food against oil" of the UN before the war (it was then the UN and not Saddam Hussein that the level of) that they will not be able to do this in the context of a democratic State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="72"> If the Bush administration of sources of supply of the oil industry, safe and cheap, it was sufficient to lift the embargo imposed to Libya, in Iran, in Iraq and in Sudan, and of course the oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="73"> But the interests of the Iraqi people is not dictated by the economy or by energy policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="74"> The Bush administration has recognised that the Iraqi oil is first and foremost a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="75"> That control of Iraqi oil, control of Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="76"> Saddam has had his power at the fact that the second. </SEG> 
<SEG id="77"> He knew perfectly well what it was in the black gold. </SEG> 
<SEG id="78"> Faced with the possibility of the invasion and the defeat, it has threatened to put out the fire. </SEG> 
<SEG id="79"> The devastation of the Iraqi oil and gas pipelines shows that virtually everyone has understood that controlling oil, it is monitoring the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="80"> During the preparation of the invasion by the USA, the oil fields was a priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="81"> The aim was not an increase in supply or a fall in prices on the American market, but the removal of Saddam Hussein and its replacement by a new government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="82"> The future of Iraq is linked to the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="83"> But given the whims of the oil market, especially in a situation as unstable, they do not see how the Bush administration will manage to achieve its objectives in the years to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="84"> The problem is simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="85"> The USA must use the income from oil to lighten the load can change of system which is based on the taxpayers of the Americans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="86"> In the long term, all reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export volumes of oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="87"> If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises it has made to the Iraqi people, the American people and to the international Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="88"> Before the invasion, Iraq was a production capacity of three million barrels of oil a day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="89"> But it will not be able to return to this level of production in the time allowed for establishing an Iraqi government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="90"> An increase in the production of the development of the oil, which requires investment, a government in place and political stability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="91"> Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expects that these conditions are met. </SEG> 
<SEG id="92"> The political stability is the first condition for increasing the capacity of production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="93"> The experience of Iran, of Kuwait, Russia and even of Iraq, shows that it is about three years of political stability before the production capacity can increase of a significant and lasting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="94"> It will be a number of years to Iraq to draw up a new Constitution, to establish a democratic government, and the distribution of incomes between the various regions, the regulation of investments and to make the economy attractive to investors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="95"> It will take time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and the neighbouring countries the implementation of feasibility studies and technical studies needed, so that the reconstruction, rehabilitation and the exploration of its oil fields. </SEG> 
<SEG id="96"> Also, even a period of 3 years, but, because it assumes that during this time, the occupation, has set up their own government and that it put an end to the political instability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="97"> Yet the reality of risk to be quite another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="98"> Important tensions can exist for years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="99"> And it would not be surprising that the production of Iraqi oil stops, even with a democratic government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="100"> History shows that strikes and the social unrest that production more more easily in a democratic context that under a dictatorship. </SEG> 
<SEG id="101"> If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the next few years, this will be a thorn in the foot, both for the foreign policy for the energy policy of the USA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="102"> How long term is able to finance the reconstruction of Iraq? </SEG> 
<SEG id="103"> Who will pay for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in Iraq? </SEG> 
<SEG id="104"> The us able to maintain their staff without assuring the feeding of the Iraqi people, the medical care and other basic services? </SEG> 
<SEG id="105"> These are difficult issues, and they cannot just before a system of controls and guarantees the Iraqi oil production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="106"> Let the murderers to defend human rights </SEG> 
<SEG id="107"> If it were not so sad, it would be the Millennium: Libya has been elected to chair the United Nations Commission on human rights! </SEG> 
<SEG id="108"> When named in the Senate, with, at least, not of blood on his. </SEG> 
<SEG id="109"> Of course, the process was perfectly: the Presidency changes every year from one region to another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="110"> This year, it was at the turn of the procedures of the President and it has appointed the chair. </SEG> 
<SEG id="111"> Only the United States and Canada have voted against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="112"> In their infinite shame, the European countries have abstained. </SEG> 
<SEG id="113"> This says a lot about the failure of the United Nations and that this decision comes at a very delicate moment for this organisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="114"> President Bush has challenged the United Nations to demonstrate their serious with regard to their own binding decisions concerning Iraq: in the case of the opposite, they can experience the same fate as the League of Nations, which has proved itself in the 1930s, when it is confronted with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and the fascist Italy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="115"> The election of the chair of the United Nations, to uphold the rights of man at the present time to support the legitimacy or moral authority and influence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="116"> Remember that the chair is a totalitarian dictatorship; its leader, a sometimes changing to the political groups in supporting the dictators of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="117"> It is one of the most of the world, in which there is no election and where the opposite opinions are repressed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="118"> Under his reign, has supported the terrorist organisations from the whole world, go to the Palestinian extremist groups. </SEG> 
<SEG id="119"> It is still the sanctions from the United Nations for the role it has played in the attacks against a flying above, Scotland, ten years ago. </SEG> 
<SEG id="120"> In the course of the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the global Community and has been consistently undermined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="121"> They are themselves unable to stop the war in the Balkans and in at least one case, Srebrenica, the United Nations for the maintenance of peace and the worst massacre of Europe while the Bosnian Serbs about 6 000 Muslims without defence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="122"> A Commission of inquiry Dutch later of the United Nations was, in fact, accomplices in this war crimes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="123"> In Rwanda, when the country has started, the representative of the United Nations in maintaining peace has ordered the evacuation of the United Nations forces of the country, leaving the country, since the second world war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="124"> The name of this representative of the United Nations is Kofi Annan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="125"> It is a depressing and pathetic that the United Nations to prevent, probably in vain, to buy in appearing, in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and the international legitimacy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="126"> But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq resemble the sending of the salvation army to remove a band, it may be that the election of the chair at the head of the Commission of human rights remains a historic date, one of the failure of the creation of an organisation which had raised an immense hope. </SEG> 
<SEG id="127"> The organizations in general, and also, it has too much State reason not to ensure that the United Nations will continue to make reality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="128"> But they will only a shadow of what they should, and can, be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="129"> The United Nations today, in a poor reputation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="130"> The supporters of the authority are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="131"> Last year, the judges of the Court in the last Thursday, were sentenced to one year of prison. </SEG> 
<SEG id="132"> I am guilty, in my capacity as chief editor of the weekly, according to the Court, made towards a suspect, that of business, for having understood his possible involvement in a fire in the market of textiles from South-East Asia of force and for having instigated riots in broadcasting lies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="133"> My case and other similar cases, once more, the end of a democratic experience in Indonesia? </SEG> 
<SEG id="134"> 'riot "I instigated produced in March last year, when nearly 200 louts have tackled the offices of the, threatening the building, the staff and a journalist. </SEG> 
<SEG id="135"> To try to resolve the situation of a peaceful, I was convinced of the Central office of police force and it, had it had the power to the police station. </SEG> 
<SEG id="136"> I was struck by foot and of the police force of police. </SEG> 
<SEG id="137"> Fortunately, many journalists have come to our rescue with and these events. </SEG> 
<SEG id="138"> The broadcasting of these pictures public indignation and Parliament to open a public inquiry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="139"> The representatives of the national police and police of the police, due to the pressure of public opinion, pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="140"> However, for itself the investigation of police in stating simply announced that its supporters without informing and without its agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="141"> It to itself by the following, against Ahmad, the author of the Article, teuku Ali, the editor, and myself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="142"> The one year were marked by a series of developments in a suspect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="143"> First of all, the matter up by the police and the general contained so apparently falsified documents that the police officers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="144"> But the Court our call for suspension of hearings until the clarification of the legality of the issue of the public Prosecutor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="145"> The file against officials involved lead nowhere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="146"> On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to the head of the new anti-terrorist unit which has to be created (and is funded by the United States). </SEG> 
<SEG id="147"> The other one, was referred to the police College to get a specialized training. </SEG> 
<SEG id="148"> Then, after six months of hearings, the continued application of the panel of the three judges was suddenly to take the head of a local Court at a time of force. </SEG> 
<SEG id="149"> One of my lawyers in 35 years of practice in the Court, it had never seen a judge to be replaced in business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="150"> In fact, in spite of its promotion, the continued to chairing another matter in the same building. </SEG> 
<SEG id="151"> A judge who in the past was ruled against the then civil by 22. </SEG> 
<SEG id="152"> Finally, for, at the time of its business, introduced a false evidence have been interviewed by the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="153"> A recording of the telephone conversation was during the hearings, the journalist having carried out the discussion and the two authors who under oath, the telephone company in the official documents attesting to this appeal as proof of its existence and that the voices of the tax was one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="154"> However, the request of the petition the arrest, so that it is for us to influence the police, something that we have made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="155"> The judges have then rejected our request for postponement of the decision of the Court until the matter of the business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="156"> In view of all these defects of form, my conviction and my death sentence are hardly surprising. </SEG> 
<SEG id="157"> But I hope to win in the end when the appeal will be lodged in front of the top. </SEG> 
<SEG id="158"> The higher courts are more respectful of ethics and the director of the Supreme Court is a staunch defender of democracy and freedom of expression, the matter of the could well become a decisive step for our democracy, just as the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the United States in the business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="159"> Having raised the threshold of tolerance in the accusations against slander, this decision has allowed the press with representatives of public Affairs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="160"> No country knows better than the part that freedom of expression and the freedom of the press are the democratic development of democratic development and that journalists is one of the first symptoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="161"> Indonesia was a Liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the muzzling the press by the President, assisted by the military junta in 1956. </SEG> 
<SEG id="162"> Any criticism of having been stifled, the consolidation of the against power was easier and, in July, in July the issue of the decree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="163"> During the first few years which followed the fall in 1966, all the advantages of a true democracy, including the freedom of the press, freedom of the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="164"> However, the regime of President Suharto also launched in the muzzling the press at the beginning of the 1970s, by suspending various newspapers and imprisoning many journalists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="165"> The media muzzled, other political rights quickly scorned and the Indonesian once more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="166"> Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia is the third largest democratic country in the world and the first world Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="167"> The elections free, fair and peaceful twice for the election of the Parliament and the direct election of the President, including the last presidential elections, their possible coexistence between Islam and democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="168"> The enemies of democracy will never ever. </SEG> 
<SEG id="169"> The extremist Islamic groups are launched in bomb attacks without distinction, whereas the groups in the West in close to the President Megawati. </SEG> 
<SEG id="170"> But Mrs Megawati has lost the recent presidential elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="171"> Will the new President-elect, to persecute the journalists? </SEG> 
<SEG id="172"> My conviction, and the trial and against other journalists, mark the beginning of the end of the beginning of the end so hard won? </SEG> 
<SEG id="173"> The answer lies in the support that all will be able to generate nationally and internationally. </SEG> 
<SEG id="174"> Waste Indonesia, the hope of all the democratic within the world Community, would be a tremendous defeat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="175"> The moral of the death penalty </SEG> 
<SEG id="176"> They often the United States to abolish the death penalty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="177"> There are many people to claim today that the abolition of the death penalty is a necessary condition for establishing a civilised system of criminal law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="178"> The Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker of this opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="179"> The European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty - the European Union was completely, and some consider that its use in the United States, of the barbarism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="180"> In fact, many European intellectuals estimates that the death penalty, and any trouble in general, does not the criminals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="181"> But then that the Europeans, with rates well below those in the United States during the last century, have for a long time to allow a certain "" in respect of the majority of crimes, it saw their brutal way over the last twenty years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="182"> On the contrary, the Americans have fallen in part thanks to the use of aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="183"> The death penalty is part of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="184"> I am for the performance of certain persons accused of killing for, and for this reason alone, I believe that it prevents other murders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="185"> If I was not convinced, I am opposed to the death penalty, for revenge and other incentives or do not have to use alternative to a public policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="186"> The serious empirical research on the death penalty in the United States have started with a review of ehrlich Isaac, published in 1975 in the American economic review. </SEG> 
<SEG id="187"> Some studies that have sometimes have discovered a power of weaker, others a stronger effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="188"> However, the information available are enough evidence, it is not based solely on the evidence of its conclusions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="189"> Of course, the public policy in the matter of punishment can perfect proof. </SEG> 
<SEG id="190"> But even with the evidence of quantitative, which they have good reasons to believe in power in the death penalty are sufficient. </SEG> 
<SEG id="191"> The majority of people, and in particular in particular, are afraid of the dead, especially when it follows promptly and the chance of a people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="192"> As it says it about the suicide, "no man has never rejected the life so that it worth the trouble to be lived. </SEG> 
<SEG id="193"> That is our horror, the penalty... "well, schopenhauer thought that" when the horrors of life are reaching the point where they exceed the horrors of the dead, a man puts an end to his life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="194"> But the terrors of the dead include a considerable resistance... " </SEG> 
<SEG id="195"> The opposition to the death penalty often that the State does not have the right, to take the lives of anyone, it would be reprehensible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="196"> Yet it is a completely wrong to think that the death penalty is deterrent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="197"> To see why, assume that for every implemented, (instead of, say, to be sentenced to prison, to the number of murders be reduced to three, which is a figure well inferior to that and to other estimates of the effect of weaker. </SEG> 
<SEG id="198"> This means that for every not yet implemented, three innocent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="199"> In fact, the many lives "Member of numerous lives if it had recourse to the death penalty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="200"> To save innocent lives for each person each seems a very attractive market, and even two lives saved lives saved by a ratio cost / benefit cost in favour of the death penalty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="201"> It should be, however, that the argument in favour of the death penalty is becoming less clear-cut when the number of lives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="202"> But even if a single life was saved in every budget, the market can still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the life abolished, which is generally the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="203"> But the idea of the qualities of the and the one that is abolished. </SEG> 
<SEG id="204"> Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison. </SEG> 
<SEG id="205"> Take the case of a criminal and rationalisation of taxes and a partner behind it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="206"> Suppose that it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim reforms of this kind. </SEG> 
<SEG id="207"> It seems obvious that to save the life of such a victim must weigh more heavily than take the deficit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="208"> Of course, all the cases are not as clear, but a comparison of the lives of the individual must be part of any reasonable social policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="209"> This is why the death penalty should be used only for the murders and for less serious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="210"> When it comes to choose between India and, for example, reducing the suggestions of private is much more powerful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="211"> Although dissipate, sometimes in their country and the death penalty, I am not for its use in this type of case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="212"> One of the main arguments for Turkey is the "(marginal." </SEG> 
<SEG id="213"> If the attacks were punished by the death penalty, to kill their victims to be discovered (which is a major reason for that is proportionate to the seriousness of crimes). </SEG> 
<SEG id="214"> One of the complications may be, however, that a murderer fight with more vigour to avoid being caught, which could cause more deaths. </SEG> 
<SEG id="215"> But, although I believe that resistance to their particular State, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, is actually a proof of the death penalty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="216"> Of course, the risk of carrying worries me. </SEG> 
<SEG id="217"> My support to the death penalty a lot if the rate of execution of innocent people, was also important that many of the claim. </SEG> 
<SEG id="218"> However, I believe that in the United States offer a huge protection, both the Commission as well, that the fact that there is very little, if anything at all, from case to case of which it is proven that they are innocent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="219"> And this situation has been deeply strengthened by the development of recognition by the DNA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="220"> I say again that the debate about the death penalty is a debate on the power of which can be reduced by calls for too long). </SEG> 
<SEG id="221"> I can understand that the Commission in front of the existing evidence, although I believe that they are wrong about that as well as on the question of the good sense of the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="222"> It is very disturbing to take the lives of anyone, but sometimes extremely unpleasant acts are necessary to prevent even worse behaviour, causing the death of innocent victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="223"> The people against Putin </SEG> 
<SEG id="224"> I have contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to succeed at the first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="225"> Given that such structures and the mafia and Russia, and Russia and the judicial system, it is accepted that in order to his successor to avoid prosecution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="226"> But we, who have chosen discussions that suited to continue, and anyone who protect him and his family. </SEG> 
<SEG id="227"> I was afraid of, and to its own survival, but to the survival of the democratic idea that it was introduced in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="228"> This idea is now threatened by the successor that we have chosen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="229"> I do not wish to deny the responsibility of my support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="230"> We were not, friends, but it and I have worked together in critical situations, and I have never doubted its sincerity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="231"> Putin acted according to its convictions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="232"> The problem is that its convictions, notably the belief that Russia can prosper only if it is conducted by a single source of power, are wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="233"> And this mistake mistake is in the process of its political. </SEG> 
<SEG id="234"> Of course, no one can take responsibilities without, and this is especially true when times are confused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="235"> I did not exception to the rule, but it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="236"> When it is on 31 December 1999, it has asked for forgiveness have triggered the war in Chechnya. </SEG> 
<SEG id="237"> Putin, by contrast, seems unable to recognise and accept its mistakes, and a policy of Georgia in the eyes of the whole world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="238"> One of the first countries to set the priorities, the head of its programme of reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="239"> Russia and the system and the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="240"> The whole nation, without exception, have had to be regretted, as the Germans have made since 1945. </SEG> 
<SEG id="241"> This failure, because it has enabled the faith in the Central authority to a new State by the security services. </SEG> 
<SEG id="242"> In fact, one of the consequences, the Communist Party and the Applause of the policy of those who have worked to the KGB. </SEG> 
<SEG id="243"> Even if such basic, where victims and so were so many, and the border between the two terrorism if it, a solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="244"> The option of doing nothing left of security structures and able to make their return on the political stage, in which they are managed today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="245"> The policy of political structures, and their efforts to make the necessary a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="246"> It is impossible to make the politicians and the media me, which explains that Putin has focused its attacks on the so-called 'style. </SEG> 
<SEG id="247"> The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and its acceptance of this measure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="248"> By abolishing the independent financial sources, the services of varied political life in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="249"> Without independent thought it, it is a climate of fear that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="250"> But the fear is not only, it does not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="251"> I had understood that fear and Valéry Giscard constitute the right way to conduct a modern country, and it was therefore between the citizens and the relations between the citizens and the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="252"> But this is still a political system that is as incapable of understanding and correcting the mistakes today than it was in the Soviet era. </SEG> 
<SEG id="253"> Otherwise, is, quite sincerely, take the same as the one that has accompanied the collapse of the Soviet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="254"> The people begin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="255"> It notes that the desire to create a stable and effective cannot fulfil, because a modern is governed by the day, but by the citizens informed which force their leaders to acknowledge and to correct their mistakes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="256"> And, also, of his regime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="257"> It is one of the reasons that have made with with its neighbours, the Ukraine and Georgia, and that a military presence in places, the region of Moldova. </SEG> 
<SEG id="258"> By imposing in the neighbouring regions of Russia, the Kremlin thinks that it can to persuade the sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="259"> Given that the debates in Russia are castrated and that is capable of handling the elections, a change of regime is the only solution that it remains to preserve the idea of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="260"> It is pointless to hang. </SEG> 
<SEG id="261"> Those who are opposed to Putin must decide what they want and announce that if the system fails to respect the Constitution, they have the right to force by all the means. </SEG> 
<SEG id="262"> Today, the question of power in the ballot box. </SEG> 
<SEG id="263"> As in Ukraine, in Lebanon, in the street. </SEG> 
<SEG id="264"> Nevertheless, the) </SEG> 
<SEG id="265"> An excessive taxation system and hinder the growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="266"> But an excessive taxation may also produce the same effects. </SEG> 
<SEG id="267"> Having a thin tax revenue can provide the essential public property. </SEG> 
<SEG id="268"> Worse still, a weak tax revenue in the poor countries in the recovery of tax (rather than encouraging the productivity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="269"> India illustrates the importance of a fiscal system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="270"> Has Bangalore of high technology have international and communication networks of data. </SEG> 
<SEG id="271"> Out of these, however, of help and roads in a State of loss. </SEG> 
<SEG id="272"> Whilst the team of the Chilean Ricardo Lagos to promote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="273"> As a result, the companies to Bangalore exploit their own services of buses, with private suppliers have drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="274"> The State cannot compensate for this disaster because it is mentioned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="275"> The government of India exceeds 70% of the GNP of the kind that more than half of its its interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="276"> But the debt is not the cause not only in the past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="277"> The government of India represents around 15% of GNP, against an average of around 40% of the GNP of the OECD. </SEG> 
<SEG id="278"> The financial difficulties of India rather to issue a tax system which is designed and poorly managed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="279"> The structure of the rules for the tax on the income of individuals and businesses seem reasonable in view of international standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="280"> However, the government of India income tax on the accounting for around EUR 3.7% of GNP, about half of those of the South Korea and other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="281"> Agriculture in India represents around a quarter of the GNP, but even the richest farmers do not pay taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="282"> The participation and in others are given a tax exemption on their profits, although their employees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="283"> In spite of the tax fraud is commonplace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="284"> Fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invested in the personnel or to the taxpayers, who go to prison, and which can often be while they are taking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="285"> The French broadcasting and the inherent in the system of taxes in the system of production and consumption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="286"> In this context, account for more than 60% of the heart of India, which represent their countries the same proportion of its complete tax revenues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="287"> The right of Eurostat has been set up to 16% of the value of the production of a business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="288"> Various ladder. </SEG> 
<SEG id="289"> For example, a "of 8% categories as food products,, the son of cotton and computers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="290"> A 'right of 8% to 8% duty on products which consist in in, cars, falls. </SEG> 
<SEG id="291"> A "additional" (not to be confused with the 'right of 8%) is taken on the ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="292"> The exemptions from excise duty are numerous and complex, including the enterprises with total and businesses located in certain areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="293"> In general, the success of the divided into talent and lists, each containing many elements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="294"> The success of abuse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="295"> To a certain amount, from the bottom of the hierarchy, which shows a discretion in the application of the conditions, can be encouraged to give favourable interpretations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="296"> The only (for example, the) are sold as current (for example, as). </SEG> 
<SEG id="297"> For example, it is more than that the tax fraud on the benefits and the income. </SEG> 
<SEG id="298"> If a business and that the rate of taxation is raised in relation to the margins, as before, in industry, in reality in order to be able to survive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="299"> Whilst the obtains "additional" or "special" which encourage a greater fraud. </SEG> 
<SEG id="300"> The perception of direct taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="301"> According to a recent for excise duties, the difference between the value and, and with the times of which can be declared on forms of tax revenues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="302"> In addition to the ability of the State to provide essential public property, the systems of counterbalancing the systems of technologies more productive, this requires a more productive, on a large scale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="303"> But as the indirect taxation can be more easily resides in place of a single great unity, it is impossible to carry out of economies of scale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="304"> It is important to note that in the software industry, where all the more space, efficient and effective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="305"> The example of China, a country in which the tax system in 1994 has prepared the ground for a great known? </SEG> 
<SEG id="306"> Or the governments of the coalition in a democracy in a vigorous of such a reform? </SEG> 
<SEG id="307"> Last year, the government led by India has issued a reduction of the budget deficit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="308"> It has appointed a working Group responsible for drawing the necessary changes to bring to public expenditure and fiscal policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="309"> In July last year, the working Party has proposed to increase rather than reduce taxes (3) of the majority of the tax system, among other things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="310"> The new government led by the Congress of India also seems to support these proposals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="311"> If the Congress and the opposition parties to follow, they will help to support the economic growth of the country and to dispel the idea that the democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage the development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="312"> What is the problem with Turkey? </SEG> 
<SEG id="313"> On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most, will have to face it must respond to the accusation of "insults to the national identity" to be pronounced in favour of an open debate on the genocide by the genocide of the Armenians in 1915. </SEG> 
<SEG id="314"> The administrations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="315"> The efforts of Turkey to impose fines and penalties of prison to those which go beyond the framework persuade me that I had reason to oppose the opening of negotiations on the accession of this country to the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="316"> In December 1999, the European Council has granted the status of candidate country of the EU, which meant that the Union in the Union to another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="317"> The Council has also asked the European Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey met the criteria necessary to membership, which consist of democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="318"> This decision has been one of the last taken by the Commission, Romano Prodi, of which I was a Member. </SEG> 
<SEG id="319"> Among its 30 Members, 29 stated that are necessary in order to be able to continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="320"> I have been the only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="321"> It is the report of the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then, of the enlargement of the EU, which is why my decision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="322"> This report mentioned that in 2003, compromises have asked for asylum in the EU, among whom 2 which have been accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="323"> In other words, the governments of the EU themselves have acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had more than 2 000 of its own citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="324"> In the meantime, the Commission has published a progress report on Turkey thinking that the reforms, although at a slower pace, under the government of the Islamic Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="325"> This report was the crossing of the violations of human rights, including the practice of torture, including the influence of the practice of torture; freedom of expression was not freedom of expression non-Muslim religious minorities and were victims of discrimination and violence against women did not a sufficiently strong opposition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="326"> The situation has not changed much since the talks on membership have started in October. </SEG> 
<SEG id="327"> Beyond the persecution of which is currently the victim, the unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="328"> In March 2005, the police force intervened in a demonstration celebrating international women's day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="329"> In may, the largest trade Union has been banned for having supported the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language. </SEG> 
<SEG id="330"> It is indisputable that reaches to the Turkish government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="331"> The Minister of foreign Affairs Minister Gül recently written by way of a press Conference in Copenhagen when it has a Kurdish language in public that the governments have refused to make out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="332"> Such acts and of such justify my 23 October 2004. </SEG> 
<SEG id="333"> But even if these shortcomings were corrected, Turkey should not really be allowed in the EU, because this is not a European country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="334"> Christianity,, the renaissance, the light, the dynamic of we Europeans that we are, but they have not done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="335"> I am not sure that reforms in Turkey, implemented due to the insistence of the European Commission, would be continued after accession. </SEG> 
<SEG id="336"> I suspect that Lisbon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="337"> In addition, the admission of Turkey would lead to bound to that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="338"> These first three countries are surely more European than Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="339"> Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but in including the States that have succeeded in Yugoslavia, that prosperity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="340"> What kind of it? </SEG> 
<SEG id="341"> The EU is not simply a club of friends. </SEG> 
<SEG id="342"> It is based on the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="343"> The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties of the Union, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must persuade, and if necessary, and if necessary to change their laws. </SEG> 
<SEG id="344"> The policies relating to alcohol in Sweden, Germany and the discrimination against the funds of foreign investments in France are examples of cases that have made the Commission unpopular. </SEG> 
<SEG id="345"> But they were needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="346"> In the time I have left the Commission, I had in a pile of 1 500 market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="347"> In short, the accession to the EU implies acceptance that the internal Affairs of a State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="348"> It is impossible to guarantee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="349"> The example of horizontal. " </SEG> 
<SEG id="350"> It would be a way of unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="351"> It is for this reason that the former French President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that the entry of Turkey does not lead to the end of the EU, and it is for this reason that the former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt said: "the accession of Turkey would be more than what the EU could not support it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="352"> But according to the accession of Turkey is a matter of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="353"> The crisis, the Latin America </SEG> 
<SEG id="354"> To summarize, the countries of Latin America, far from there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="355"> And if this if it, it would be the poorest country in the Western democratic: it is even less stable as its history and its two hundred and since its independence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="356"> In a region in the past to, but at present the case, and with the countries of Latin America, where the people represent the majority of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="357"> These are rooted and even threaten that threaten the unity of a much more way that everywhere else. </SEG> 
<SEG id="358"> And it is, of course, with, of course, of all the public access to the sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="359"> So, although it would be of little the crisis that is currently in the rest of Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="360"> The 21st century, the institutions are strong, poverty, and particularly the misery, has been reduced and the taking of natural resources have been largely regulated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="361"> Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has huge reserves of oil and that is endowed with a nationalist government, in the spirit of the status quo maintained has enabled the preservation of foreign investments for the almost eight years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="362"> Even if the existence of movements is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas to ",", up until they have never, never put any real threat to national integrity in any country of Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="363"> Thus, did not have a crisis, no more than the theory of weaken and nearly believed in the case of the does not entirely reasonable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="364"> However, the current crisis in Bolivia points out the 'democratic deficit' that Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="365"> The elected leaders are placed in - for one reason or another, and in Haiti. </SEG> 
<SEG id="366"> Democracy is anxious, Mexico and in Nicaragua and sees the mere themes and in Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="367"> None of these cases and to the other and they include all different degrees of danger, destruction and of reconciliation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="368"> That is what can be done about this, that a hard with the perspectives that which prevailed until these last years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="369"> At the last meeting of the organisation of American States which is specific, the delegation from the United States has a good idea provided by simply because of its support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="370"> History has begun says, former foreign Minister of foreign Affairs, and the United Nations development programme (UNDP) were responsible for preparing a report on the democracy in Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="371"> Their conclusions pointed out that a system of early warning of the in the area of help in terms of control, as this is the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="372"> Mr blue Democrats, President Lagos, responsibility and his colleagues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="373"> What it has done without initiative go very far. </SEG> 
<SEG id="374"> In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, mentioned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="375"> The United States and the new Secretary-General of the majority of the inhabitants, during the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by the fears that it is an action against the Venezuela, linked to the anachronistic American involvement on the violation of the sacrosanct principle of no intervention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="376"> In spite of these were to agree on the principle, the idea of a system of early warning system to be studied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="377"> Today, the Community has probably little chance of God, and yet it is dangerous for the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="378"> Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and truths, perhaps, a little, but its supporters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="379"> The possession of values and the other, but the Venezuela and Cuba are not tried to interfere in the Affairs of this country where it believed died at the head of the guerrillas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="380"> The Community of business practice will not perhaps following its threats, but but share the reserves of oil and natural gas from their region with the people of their rather than with the people of? </SEG> 
<SEG id="381"> Before the events of extremes, it would perhaps be a good idea if the (and not the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="382"> The region is, in terms of time, elsewhere, Latin American intervention from and of Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="383"> The decline of France? </SEG> 
<SEG id="384"> The other regions, not to say on the defensive, with regard to the Chechen abroad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="385"> The French State spend a lot of money to the broadcasting of the language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that their country is no longer what it was. </SEG> 
<SEG id="386"> In this context, it is therefore not surprising that during the last presidential elections, the publication of a report from the European Commission stating that the European countries was passed the 3 </SEG> 
<SEG id="387"> The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to make these data,, put an end to this aspect of the debate in showing that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom and all levels of life to almost identical. </SEG> 
<SEG id="388"> But the talks to a more extensive has not disappeared. </SEG> 
<SEG id="389"> That leaves the French have made their protest to the steps which took place this year against the reform of the Commission, on fiscal policy with the European Commission and the effective on the war in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="390"> The work gains a great success in France at the moment is a debate in writing by the grave. </SEG> 
<SEG id="391"> The position is filled shows. </SEG> 
<SEG id="392"> According to the author, still in the 1970s, the debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="393"> It Mitterrand and negotiate to win the elections and to make. </SEG> 
<SEG id="394"> The success of the book is in itself a sign of Israel ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="395"> But of what kind? </SEG> 
<SEG id="396"> The religion are not as it wishes to believe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="397"> For example, it invites the exhaustion of industrial jobs as the absence of France. </SEG> 
<SEG id="398"> But the reality is a common to all countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="399"> In fact, the politically better results than the majority of its neighbours and, contrary to the path of Germany, or of the United States, it has the same share of the world market in the area of industrial sector at the beginning of the 1970s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="400"> Moreover, according to a much more accurate of competitiveness and of foreign investments, France get good results in these areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="401"> According to a recent report published by the Council of economic analysis, the direct investments in France are direct to 60 billion in 2001, once more that Germany. </SEG> 
<SEG id="402"> The citizens want is also improved (20%) in the last three decades, the rapid growth of wages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="403"> But the heart of economic problems on the long term of France lies precisely in the handling of fear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="404"> The case of traditional sectors such as the car and face, but it has taken from the delay in dangerous technologies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="405"> France, for example, only 30 billion dollars per year in the research and development and the development of technologies, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for the Japan and 265 billion dollars for the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="406"> In short, the analysis of will hand in the wrong direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="407"> France has made a number of extremely important reforms on the last two decades: the liberalisation of economic and financial, the elimination of controls of prices and of exchanges, the end of liberty, the reduction of deficits,, the advent of the euro and the accession countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="408"> The French government has certainly not been led by these reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="409"> The issue of France comes from the fact that it has not managed to recognise the new world which is already part. </SEG> 
<SEG id="410"> The French capitalism is dead and France does not manage to accept its disappearance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="411"> France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has felt obliged to introduce have said to the public that "the State is not". </SEG> 
<SEG id="412"> There are several reasons to explain this to the French, but the most important of them is the policy of the last 20 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="413"> In 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left. </SEG> 
<SEG id="414"> Since this period, and are put into effect the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and to globalisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="415"> A ‘ treatment requirements to the Thatcher, everywhere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="416"> But the slow and banks to live in a world and think in another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="417"> This State of Affairs explains in great part of the disaster at the last year, when the leader of the extreme right Jean-Marie Le Pen has reached the second round of the presidential elections in the face of the sitting, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="418"> The rise of the extreme left, that of the 10% of the vote during this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="419"> France has need of a good policy much more than an economic revolution if it wants to accept the reality, in particular the fact that the French government is a fear created by the French people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="420"> The value of European values </SEG> 
<SEG id="421"> The European leaders have taken the constitutional discussions which had come to an end in December last year following a disagreement on the voting rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="422"> These debates must of course lead to compromises, which cannot be struck. </SEG> 
<SEG id="423"> Still remains to understand clearly which are supposed to be the objectives of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="424"> Two fundamental principles have chaired the European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="425"> These two principles are held to the philosophy of the philosophy, politics, the economy, and that right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="426"> For years, they have made an integral part of the legal and institutional framework of the European Union, in the Treaties, in the Charter of fundamental rights that the preamble) and in the recent draft Constitution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="427"> To sum up, they are registered in the history and the ideals of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="428"> But what is the real significance of these two principles? </SEG> 
<SEG id="429"> Take the solidarity, which is good, as the distribution of income and wealth, and the concept of solidarity, which deals with the production of income and wealth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="430"> In the history of European integration, the active in the course of the first period, that of the European Community coal and steel, both in its strategy of economic development (reconstruction) in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="431"> That does not mean that has been abolished by the following: the European monetary Union, for example, indefinitely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="432"> Thus, although some countries do not have the support of the euro, they have Nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that it would be beneficial effects on the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="433"> In other words, policies that promote investment, innovation, economic growth and employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="434"> However, as the growth of GNP in the EU, has been undermined in the course of the last decade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="435"> The gap between the research and development is a subject particularly worrying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="436"> The implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the most competitive economy in the world, is threatened by the growing importance accorded to hold, which is reflected in the high costs of social security and the high costs of its funding. </SEG> 
<SEG id="437"> The primacy of the solidarity to is due to an aging population that differ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="438"> One of the biggest challenges posed in the future of the EU is to treat the actual predominance of the, which is oriented towards the elderly people, at the expense of solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="439"> After all, the European Union cannot allow that continues to take on the investment necessary to the future prosperity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="440"> Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in its interpretation is also leads: the vertical and horizontal subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="441"> The vertical subsidiarity with regard to the distribution of powers between the various levels of government and of government of the EU, the Member States, the regions and municipalities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="442"> The application of the financial crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="443"> The European Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="444"> But is it enough to include the of the Union? </SEG> 
<SEG id="445"> Subsidiarity means that bears the responsibility and the freedom of human beings as well as on the social and economic powers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="446"> It includes the relations between the State, society and the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="447"> But the company and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignty which are not granted by the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="448"> The problem then arises: how to guarantee the UK? </SEG> 
<SEG id="449"> As an example of the European internal market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and freedom of competition between businesses in the protection that the national governments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="450"> The horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the State cannot violate the freedom and responsibility of the individual, which must be respected at the highest possible level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="451"> It also means that a 'pass every time that the freedom and responsibility of the individual are not enough to achieve the objectives needed to human dignity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="452"> This support must, however, be given by methods which favour the individuals, society and the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="453"> But this is only possible if the role of subsidiarity is clearly enunciated, which has not been the case in the European Treaties, the Charter of fundamental rights or the work of the European Convention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="454"> To sum up, the scenario, rather than a growth (this is so that the present generation of expressing solidarity with future generations) whilst subsidiarity with regard to the distribution of power policy rather than a careful definition of separating the State, civil society and the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="455"> At present, these two values are defined in such a way as to facilitate the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="456"> In fact, the emphasis placed on the growth oriented towards the market has often been identified with the values of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="457"> But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they have to be once again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="458"> The EU must restore its full employment and a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, more balanced in favour of the market and of the company, which reduce the influence of the social State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="459"> The public institutions must produce goods (such as defence, justice and the fiscal and monetary policy), society must offer social (as the culture, education and help) and the market must produce the goods to growth and to employment). </SEG> 
<SEG id="460"> In the 21st century, Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it wants to carry out the historical objective: the freedom and the necessary to overcome the differences and divisions that have led to the tragedies in the course of the 20th century. </SEG> 
<SEG id="461"> That is the spirit in which must be worked out the European Constitution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="462"> The political values </SEG> 
<SEG id="463"> The debate on the American elections has still not penalized. </SEG> 
<SEG id="464"> How will the President George W. Bush and, Moreover, of more than Senator John Kerry, and, Moreover, give a Republican majority in the back of the Congress? </SEG> 
<SEG id="465"> One of the answers, but two topics are top of many explanations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="466"> One of these topics due to his personality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="467"> Has our full of uncertainties and threat, the citizens have placed their trust in a President that they knew rather than in a candidate who has not yet proved its worth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="468"> The second is that of values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="469"> The citizens have voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="470"> In fact, some are in line with the policies of Mr John but have brought their voices to Mr Bush because they are with the whole of his attitude. </SEG> 
<SEG id="471"> It is clear that the United States are now deeply divided into electoral terms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="472"> To avoid) to the East, in the North and in the North and the governments and to the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="473"> Beyond the geographical division, at local level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="474"> The Minister of finance, to promote a political Party at the expense of another, is no longer necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="475"> The voters will tend to move in areas where the majority of the inhabitants and their values, that they are Democrats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="476"> What are these values exactly? </SEG> 
<SEG id="477"> These are the values which, contrary to what we are told, "of God, weapons and start. </SEG> 
<SEG id="478"> Religion plays a role, in particular with the discovery of credit to the Bible in the field of the history of the creation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="479"> The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of the individualism and the use of weapons in times of war has nothing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="480"> The catch and other practices, because. </SEG> 
<SEG id="481"> As the political said recently, "the candidature of Mr Bush has been built to form a majority in giving to 60 million voters the chance to feel well in relation to themselves". </SEG> 
<SEG id="482"> All of this is a phenomenon or other trends elsewhere? </SEG> 
<SEG id="483"> One of the answers that in Amsterdam, the policy of the policy of a majority today but is not enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="484"> Europe and other regions of the world are divided in the same way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="485"> The treatment, and under the political differences evident are also questions of values that have not yet been implemented. </SEG> 
<SEG id="486"> However, the difference in EU based on the disagreement concerning the basic values of play an increasingly important role in the elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="487"> The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, for example, solid in his country, the development of personality and speaks, but is above all a set of values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="488"> When he talks of "modernisation" or "to enter the twenty-first century ', it manages to suggest a strange but engaging and stability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="489"> That leaves the opposition and without any effective response. </SEG> 
<SEG id="490"> Even the questions of the right of asylum and of more stringent do not manage to make the on the values that the Republican Party has managed to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="491"> The situation is the same in Germany, where the political influence of recession. </SEG> 
<SEG id="492"> The debate, in Germany, even in the most part of the political debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="493"> When the opposition to the reform of the social protection or, more recently, the fight against unemployment, the challenge is not put in terms of values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="494"> However, in the fields of traditional political debate English or German, or elsewhere in Europe, in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="495"> The parties are fighting for those who can 'feel comfortable in their own place', but they do not understand very well that it is only partly a question of policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="496"> What will be an important factor in European policy: the opinion polls show that the religious practice remains one of the few main difference between Americans and Europeans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="497"> The weapons also occupies a place in the minds of Europeans: it is their forces that Europeans see as important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="498"> Europe is also, without doubt, the bench. </SEG> 
<SEG id="499"> And the question of the politically correct the also plays a role for up to now in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="500"> Above all, Europe itself, the Europeans, because the "national question" is present in all the European States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="501"> It is a question of values inspired by fear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="502"> The citizens want to know where they are and, in the same breath, turned against the United States and in Europe or against Europe and for their own countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="503"> It is difficult, we await the Kingdom of policies and of the policy and policy in the field of symbols and myths. </SEG> 
<SEG id="504"> That, in any case, represent the main danger which democracies must face, because the political values is a dangerous development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="505"> It reintroduces the divisions of a society which the democratic success was precisely to the age of political life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="506"> A public debate light must be a debate on the political manoeuvres by a Community of values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="507"> It is therefore essential to insist on this essential objective of the policy of freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="508"> The advent of the interest </SEG> 
<SEG id="509"> One swallow does not make a summer and a single month of normal growth of employment and of rising prices in the United States does not mean that the federal reserve fears more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="510"> But the time will come when the rate of interest, as the Central bankers are preparing to resist the wave of it going. </SEG> 
<SEG id="511"> When that time will come, it is this autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the world economy will face difficulties which the success of the last three years of monetary Union in stopping the decline of the production and in softening the unemployment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="512"> The short-term interest rates are low down: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the United States and in Japan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="513"> Monetary policy has proved to be a success, but only after having led the rate of interest to historical low levels and have convinced that the costs of the costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="514"> The monetary has largely had the effect of increasing the price of active: all this guilt or a becomes much more attractive, and therefore much more valuable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="515"> This explains the considerable differences between the prices of the market, the United States, in new York, London and Frankfurt, and the obligations on the long term everywhere in the world and this should be, conventional way, their basic values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="516"> What will happen when the Central banks will begin to increase their interest rates? </SEG> 
<SEG id="517"> In 1994, the increase in the rate of interest in the short term has led to an increase in rates on the long term (and a fall in prices and a reduction of at least the double envisaged by the European standard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="518"> The decision in the process of development in addition has much more than the rate of major industrial countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="519"> The first risk for 2005 and for the years to come, when the rate of interest rate will increase, as it is very likely, is another wave of financial crises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="520"> For countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, India, Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, the record of the 1990s shows that the differences in the level of interest rates can grow and the flow of capital, regardless of the degree to which the representatives of the IMF and the analyses carried out by the big banks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="521"> The gaps in the framework of development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="522"> The flow of capital, if possible, in the United States, are still not on the partners to a "irrational exuberance", but it is a good opportunity for this to happen before the rates of interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="523"> This perspective is alarming because if there is a lesson to be learnt from 1990, it is that it is the stability of the international financial flows. </SEG> 
<SEG id="524"> The second danger arising from the high prices in the main industrial countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="525"> The way of thinking role within the federal reserve, which I fully endorse, supports that the revolution of the technologies of the information continues, that the effectiveness of the still very quickly and that the big. </SEG> 
<SEG id="526"> This implies that the interest rate will certainly remain low for a relatively long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="527"> In addition, the confidence in the federal reserve and the last prevail over the years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="528"> As a result, even after the levels of production are back to their potential level, interest rates, low according to the standards of the 1980s and 1990s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="529"> All of this is, of course, good news for all those who hold assets such as obligations in the long term, actions and hold them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="530"> In fact, the increase in the price of the active on the long term was precisely what precisely the fall in interest rates of, and particularly the property owners, and, after all, a shot in the arm. </SEG> 
<SEG id="531"> But the bad news is that, even if the rate of interest are supposed to remain low for some time, they do not remain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="532"> The most important thing, however, is that when the rate of interest, the values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="533"> It is during these periods, and particularly when the values of the values of the Fund, and that we judge the degree of competence of our Central bankers in their main task: to reduce the volatility of the financial and economic stability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="534"> It is also during these periods that we discover how the resolution that all the obligations in the long term, of property or actions have not because they believe that the current prices are interesting in relation to costs, but because their prices have increased over recent years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="535"> It is a crucial issue for the policies for the individuals who have bought on the long term because the costs are increasing to are also those who sell from that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="536"> In particular, the fact that the instability in cases where the costs of active on the long term should fall considerably. </SEG> 
<SEG id="537"> It is certain that the challenges which the economic policies of the world during the years to come the years they have been overcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="538"> The risks associated with rather less dangerous than those manner and the threat of deflation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="539"> But, as we have learned in the course of the years, this does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="540"> America </SEG> 
<SEG id="541"> I have recently Saddam Hussein, who is in charge of international finance and those who are in charge of the economy have have very different points of view - in fact, rejected - on the possible consequences of the huge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="542"> The division of the financial crisis is possible, followed by a line. </SEG> 
<SEG id="543"> The growth of the economy of the value of the dollar, not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="544"> Those who as follows: at some point in the future, the Central banks, the less inclined to ditch. </SEG> 
<SEG id="545"> When they put an end to their populations, on a large scale, the value of the dollar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="546"> And, from this point of view, if the value of the dollar and of the employment market, American and apply the new areas of use in full. </SEG> 
<SEG id="547"> The situation is comparable to that of Britain when it Britain exchanges and Let the pound sterling report at the German mark, or what happened in the United States at the end of the 1980s when the United States in relation to the book, mark and - especially - by the Japanese yen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="548"> The division of the funds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="549"> They think that the end of large scale by the Central banks will lead not only to the decline of the dollar, but also to a rise in the long term, in the long term, this will control the privileges of investment after a short space of time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="550"> Surely, also consider that the exports of the use of the fall in the dollar but the widows, but that does not produce that one or two years after the decline of the consumption and investment expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="551"> Eight to ten million people will pass from the services sector and of the construction of the area of goods, which implies that structural unemployment will increase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="552"> In addition, a financial panic: the large financial institutions with the obligations in the short term and in the long term and in the long term a strong increase in the rate of interest to drawn up in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="553"> This factor of inequality may lead to a certain tension: a bankruptcy just as easily as those caused during the Mexican and Asia in the 1990s or of the ten of the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="554"> When the economists of the international finance put forward this scenario, the expert in the economy have their reply that this is a case of incompetence in monetary policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="555"> Why the American federal reserve the increase in the rate of interest in the long term when their populations? </SEG> 
<SEG id="556"> It then intervene and take over by the purchase of intermediary in the long term, in the long term interest rates to a level at the full employment? </SEG> 
<SEG id="557"> The needing to this that the federal reserve does not have the capacity to do so. </SEG> 
<SEG id="558"> Obliged to choose between the full employment and the stability of prices, according to them, but according to the stability of prices, because its institutional memory and inflation remains very powerful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="559"> So, since the fall of the value of the dollar, made up of the costs to the importation and this fact operates as a negative shock from the supply side in the economic area, but this will increase and not to reduce its interest rates and therefore to increase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="560"> Serious economists that I respect in this debate of this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="561"> I am not quite right to give some or other, but I know without any doubt which side I hope to see. </SEG> 
<SEG id="562"> The bad pupils of Europe </SEG> 
<SEG id="563"> In the United States, States that fiscal policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="564"> It is necessary for the reduction in demand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="565"> The what they have to pay it, to a certain degree, of disciplinary action against the temptation of today and of pay later. </SEG> 
<SEG id="566"> Of course, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market "and the us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="567"> However, the application of this fiscal discipline, linked to the populations of each Member State, has prevented the temptations of greater extent in the United States since the great depression. </SEG> 
<SEG id="568"> Consider the case of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="569"> Before the advent of the euro, the sabotage of causing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="570"> But with the introduction of the single currency, the way to solve a has been closed, since the European Central Bank (ECB) checks on monetary policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="571"> However, even if the Nations can no longer rely on inflation in order to solve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency to the ability to use the other Members of the European Union to extend their madness and push their political responsibility for the good. </SEG> 
<SEG id="572"> It is in order to avoid this possibility that the EU has created the stability and growth Pact: the budget deficit of budget deficit must not exceed 3% of their GDP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="573"> Last week, the German government, in the past the European country the careful and fiscal level, has broken the rules of the Pact for the rules of the rules of the Pact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="574"> The Minister of finance Minister has announced that it is expected that the European Commission applies to employment: the credibility of the Pact would, says, put in danger. </SEG> 
<SEG id="575"> So, Germany would not allow this time, as it has been the case there are two and a half years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="576"> But finance has also expressed clearly that it is expected that a purely symbolic sanction in response to the budget deficit representing 3.4% of GDP, and not to show his government or its economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="577"> The stability and growth Pact is not, or not yet, in the process of working out at the outset. </SEG> 
<SEG id="578"> That is the discipline of the market? </SEG> 
<SEG id="579"> The willingness of the German government to increase its debt and of the German government by the fact that the market and by the fact that the their position? </SEG> 
<SEG id="580"> In a word, no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="581"> The rate of interest on the debt of sovereign in euro of the governments of the euro zone are very similar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="582"> The market does not care that different countries have the potential to generate satisfactory financing of the debt, or differents aspirations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="583"> Buiter, of the university of Amsterdam and numerous, of the university of London, feel that it is the acceptance of the euro zone as guaranteed that has guaranteed the will of the market to become the fiscal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="584"> So that was the is used as a guarantee for the short term or as room hands to acquire liquid, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms under which the ECB accepts as guaranteed by its fundamental. </SEG> 
<SEG id="585"> The treatment by the offer of a kind of those countries to learn risk in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="586"> It is dangerous in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="587"> It is necessary to have both a discipline of the market and a market to have a chance to benefit from a price stability in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="588"> Certain sanction by the action or to activate the institutional levers which give a voice to future generations, and you set to suffer serious consequences - perhaps not today or tomorrow, but a day, and for the rest of your life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="589"> As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and the way in which the euro has been put in place since more and more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="590"> The policy of all of the euro zone in general is too far. </SEG> 
<SEG id="591"> This is not tolerable in regions which are already or in rather more stringent are not made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="592"> The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy in the long term are in full erosion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="593"> Now, that produces less chance of rewarding and penalizing that it should. </SEG> 
<SEG id="594"> The earth does not move again, and this will happen before now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="595"> But the floor under the euro could well become slippery if things do not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="596"> And the same, </SEG> 
<SEG id="597"> The trial of war criminals were formerly serious business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="598"> Who decides and legitimate, on the illicit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="599"> Some have even been texts, but fair. </SEG> 
<SEG id="600"> At present, the world became. </SEG> 
<SEG id="601"> The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends from one source. </SEG> 
<SEG id="602"> As well as the other and one and all forms of possible; the only thing that it has not yet done, it is decide. </SEG> 
<SEG id="603"> It is in a difficult situation, which could appear as institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="604"> During this time, the Statute of evidence and 200 million dollars spent in vain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="605"> In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government for almost ten years to know how to bring the origin before the courts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="606"> The killers, who have taken the power in the twentieth century were condemned to be killed in cities - at least, if they do not die during their term of office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="607"> Who can feel proud that the latest socially, was shot with his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial? </SEG> 
<SEG id="608"> The formal previous always preferable to a perspective, even if the end result is also the dead. </SEG> 
<SEG id="609"> Today there are two ways of proceeding to the origins. </SEG> 
<SEG id="610"> A nation can send its former leaders before the courts, as was done in the 1980s with the disappearance of the disappearance of more than 5 000 of their fellow citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="611"> At international level, the model of serve to serve as an example to others, although under the conditions that both for certain crimes, such as the 'crimes against humanity, which are not properly defined at the time when they are committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="612"> There was a time when they could see the advantages of both national and international. </SEG> 
<SEG id="613"> The trial on the national territory in the local Community of free mobility in the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="614"> In both, warned could also bring greater sensitivity to the parts of the conditions under which a dictator took its decisions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="615"> The trial of the generals in Thailand has been has been a success in the framework of the transition of the military junta to democracy, but this experience is taking place in a question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="616"> Even after their judgment, the generals have been strong enough to demand a denunciation of their school. </SEG> 
<SEG id="617"> The policy and is still entangled in the legal consequences of these processes of twenty years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="618"> At international level, the decision of the security Council of the UN to establish the international criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICC) has also been welcomed with great confidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="619"> Several under the direction of Antonio Cassese. </SEG> 
<SEG id="620"> But then the judges had the misfortune to fulfil their role the transformation in Ireland, Slobodan Milosevic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="621"> They cannot make a clear idea of the way in which the Milosevic in the framework of a trial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="622"> Many adopting monitored the Court. </SEG> 
<SEG id="623"> At international level, the involvement of did not on an excess of policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="624"> The trial of Milosevic had to be more than just, it must be the emblem of the justice of the UN. </SEG> 
<SEG id="625"> So Milosevic has been entitled to defend itself - serious error in terms of universal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="626"> There has been no limits to the number of people that it has called for in the history of the aggression and the brutality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="627"> It will be many months to determine the problem and to know why this scandal of a trial of four years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="628"> My European is that the change of influenced by the Commission of the truth and reconciliation African, model sold in schools and as an alternative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="629"> In the course of the individual, the most important question was not the future of science but in the past of the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="630"> Every victim was encouraged to tell its history and the defendant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="631"> In the case of massacres perpetrated in the twentieth century, such can can last dozens of years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="632"> To encourage the victims to talk then warned the right to monopolise the floor and block the inventiveness policy are the ingredients of a lengthy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="633"> One of the lessons that we have learned from the trial of Milosevic and one is that it should not judge of men or women for their nature. </SEG> 
<SEG id="634"> They will overturn the trial, particularly if they are entitled to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their journey. </SEG>

<SEG id="640"> The one given birth to procedures, at both national and international, which at the same time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="641"> In the case of Saddam Hussein, this person could still be achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="642"> The line of the Iraqi economy </SEG> 
<SEG id="643"> All those who see a see a divided between the communities of the Shiites, Sunnis and the Kurds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="644"> But there is another talents that with just as much to the and the opposition to military occupation, the widening gap between the rich and the poor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="645"> During this time, the system, particularly the poor people, are taken to hope that a charismatic leader of the realities of the daily life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="646"> Raised in fear, they had no idea about the way in which democracy could apply to their company or how the defence of the rights of man and of other organisations of civil rights could help to shape their future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="647"> That is facing a new line of distribution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="648"> On the one hand, were those who understood how work in a democracy, come to power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="649"> They have learned to speak the language of democracy, to stop at the same time, money and influence, and to ensure the competition of the independent organizations to defend their rights and their privileges. </SEG> 
<SEG id="650"> On the other hand, however, they find a power, in particular women widowed, divorced or left without anybody to take care, they and their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="651"> To those, democracy and human rights does not mean a great deal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="652"> They are for the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="653"> Victims of an education system that is more than ten years, they are made to find a job in the corporations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="654"> Under the yoke of Saddam Hussein, no effort was made to raise the standard of living. </SEG> 
<SEG id="655"> I have visited the greater the courage and the families within a Presidency, with passing under their doors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="656"> Night and day, they live in the dark. </SEG> 
<SEG id="657"> Having need to nothing less than food, decent houses and prospects of jobs, since the death of these families, their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="658"> When I met the women who live in, in these difficult issues: the food and homes? </SEG> 
<SEG id="659"> Would the men. </SEG> 
<SEG id="660"> Discouraging their children? </SEG> 
<SEG id="661"> A couple who have left? </SEG> 
<SEG id="662"> In all these matters, I have said ‘ yes ’. </SEG> 
<SEG id="663"> Yes, democracy will grant the right to live in a decent home, the right to learn and work, and she will and equality between men and women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="664"> But you will work hard and to make all possible efforts to demand these rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="665"> What they replied: "Saddam we have learned to be unemployed, and when and for 35 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="666"> That now? " </SEG> 
<SEG id="667"> In these rural zones that the majority of the Iraqi people, who are in the grip of temptations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="668"> There are many people who are not in the scope of the political or the government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="669"> For example, the theft and the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="670"> Poverty leads to accept some of the money in exchange of terrorist acts,, made by the promise of a which they could not exploit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="671"> Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of the history of the allocation of Iraq, education towards the assassination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="672"> Although the conditions of existence in Iraq today lead many young men towards violence, I am convinced that it is simply a matter of their provide jobs and decent accommodation for the saving. </SEG> 
<SEG id="673"> The jobs, in particular, help the young to invent new forms of employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="674"> It is not enough to make use of the army of unemployed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="675"> We must give people jobs which allow them to contribute to the reconstruction of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="676"> By nature, each individual seeks to prove useful to its own society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="677"> But the culture that Saddam has created to reconcile the only means of activity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="678"> Show such will take time and require a flourishing economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must have powers are limited in order to facilitate the growth of private sector while encouraging the growth of democracy and human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="679"> The religious groups are ready to participate in this process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="680"> We can also Saddam, so that they also have a chance to use their country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="681"> Last, but not least, we must offer loans to loans to help to build a decent life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="682"> The government must make every possible effort to persuade people to the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the Community in the realisation of their aspirations for a better life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="683"> It will not be easy to implement in a country where there are those who consider that violate the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="684"> We have, however, we, the Iraqis, how that power must not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the setting up of the rights of combating corruption in all its forms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="685"> If the Constitution should function as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, this project must learn to make their this conflict. </SEG> 
<SEG id="686"> The accusation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="687"> When you look at the present time, your (a) as a political force. </SEG> 
<SEG id="688"> Some Muslims act as incentive to action; in other countries) receive as a ‘ other ’. </SEG> 
<SEG id="689"> As I, I feel directly these two sides of the debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="690"> The reason for that Islam is a religion of ‘ other ’ in the eyes of the Community is that the West has attended to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="691"> This is not a religion that has disappeared, although, obviously, of course, but rather the claims that the institutions can issue on the individual behaviour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="692"> The age in the modern world is more than ever a personal experience and spiritual. </SEG> 
<SEG id="693"> However, a process of the United States and also within Islam. </SEG> 
<SEG id="694"> The politicisation of the authority of the infrastructures, the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="695"> As in the West, from becoming more personal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="696"> The interpretation of the texts by individual, including political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among many others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="697"> This, the work of the Koran and to support political objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="698"> Who decides on what is and what is illicit? </SEG> 
<SEG id="699"> That has sufficient authority to interpret the texts? </SEG> 
<SEG id="700"> Who can issue a look? </SEG> 
<SEG id="701"> These days, declare, or rather essential, a source of legitimacy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="702"> It is thus that decide what that means or does not mean Islam, without the authority of religious schools and capacity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="703"> In fact, today is essentially interpreted by political actors and cultural movements, and not by the institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="704"> This has allowed the passing of local and national social link to one of alliances between all the causes of the whole world who feel oppressed or displaced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="705"> The who were deeply divided: the Muslim intellectuals and the Muslims of origin; the Shiite Muslims and Muslims Saudi Arabia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="706"> The system is also leaving rural areas for the cities, including the Western cities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="707"> Many consider this motion as negative and that these individuals are socially and that they convince and, for some, the terrorism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="708"> But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="709"> Naturally, a feeling of distance from the Albanians, if it is a complete break, with their social origins. </SEG> 
<SEG id="710"> Their experience or is a means of institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="711"> The experience or becoming rather a form of discussions within which they rebuild a feeling of belonging to the Islam in an environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="712"> This is not the distance from the modern life, but always with this one, the religious identity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="713"> In fact, the great majority of radicalism in groups which, by their experience of the mobility and movement, are familiar with the political thought and city life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="714"> Individuals by an unknown environment, to the point that becomes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="715"> But for that this support works, the British collection in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="716"> In knowledge, in the right places of work or at the request of, and in need of special food, to satisfy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="717"> They inform the whole world that they are more zealous and more careful in their religious observance that the increase in the private life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="718"> For example, as the signing of the veil and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="719"> True, it is Nevertheless become for Muslims a sign of a identity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="720"> The young women and women, to approach this transformation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="721"> The young girls who adopt in the French and German schools are, namely, the culture of young people, the realisation of the method and the language), of their friends that their mothers without discrimination which are obliged to remain in the House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="722"> In adopting the for the European public sphere, these young girls who introduced the symbol and the role of women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="723"> This tendency goes well beyond simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="724"> All the feeling of belonging, a cultural capital. </SEG> 
<SEG id="725"> They define by their meaning, but they have also obtain and universal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="726"> The fact that they have this cultural capital, they can they can freely between the different activities and areas (, schools, homes of young people and for the space for). </SEG> 
<SEG id="727"> It is necessary to are two different things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="728"> In the absence of a change of associations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="729"> The me or for the individual place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="730"> The question which remains is for everyone to know if this quest of identity can be satisfied with the Members and with a broad public approval of the Islamic religious practice or if an affirmation of the opposite of the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="731"> A new era for the review clause? </SEG> 
<SEG id="732"> For several hundred years, whereas the science and operate, a region of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="733"> The Afghanistan, the priority and the people on the functioning of nature. </SEG> 
<SEG id="734"> It will be no surprise that this area has been the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="735"> In the other half of the scientists, or even killed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="736"> The subsidies, and to the age. </SEG> 
<SEG id="737"> The standard of living. </SEG> 
<SEG id="738"> The prosperous region was on the remarkable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="739"> The two regions workshops do not agree on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but the science that in one of them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="740"> Today, of course, the Middle East and West are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="741"> Since the second world war, the United States are the world leaders in the field of science. </SEG> 
<SEG id="742"> Throughout this period, the brightest students have been out of their countries of origin by the prospect of research. </SEG> 
<SEG id="743"> But, more than half of the Greens in mathematics, science and engineering in the United States were born in the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="744"> Many of these young talents are left to reinforce, and both have benefited. </SEG> 
<SEG id="745"> During this time, the culture, the culture in an historic phase in which science was comparable to the influence of the ladder for this very reason. </SEG> 
<SEG id="746"> Even in countries where the income from oil supply and a significant proportion of the research, the Arab leaders do not have encouraged such investments, and the consequence is that their companies do not have as much as they could have been. </SEG> 
<SEG id="747"> Recently, an aspiration for a larger disarmament to invest in the area, which is visible in the crime and the flight. </SEG> 
<SEG id="748"> But then that such weapons have a political weight, on which they are based. </SEG> 
<SEG id="749"> The respect humanitarian plan carefully thought out, rather than one born of discoveries, is much more significant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="750"> Imagine the millions of dollars worldwide research on cancer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="751"> And the matter of a means of making the AIDS? </SEG> 
<SEG id="752"> This opportunity does not present at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="753"> But there is another, which is not confined to the modernization. </SEG> 
<SEG id="754"> The United States have committed serious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="755"> Questions of pluralist review within the government, on the basis of the Presidency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="756"> Of the current relations by Members of staff policy when the facts contradicted the official version. </SEG> 
<SEG id="757"> Encouraged by a influenced by religion, the systems are in the Middle of the ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="758"> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the entry visas are less numerous and more difficult to obtain, which hinders the flow of young talents towards the American universities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="759"> Large organisations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="760"> At the same time, the laws of the richest in the short term, the long-term investment in research. </SEG> 
<SEG id="761"> A dollar has been devoted to the war in Iraq, a total of almost all of the thousand years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="762"> Even if the United States a clear, they risk losing their world domination in terms of research. </SEG> 
<SEG id="763"> Japan has recognised the link between political weight and science in the 1980s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="764"> The main economic, industrial, Sony, and right, have made a series of speeches which have been and under the title has been compiled and no say. </SEG> 
<SEG id="765"> They have drafted a national strategy in which the launch. </SEG> 
<SEG id="766"> The main idea is that the military power could be the 'food chain of other Nations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="767"> The title of the Green book as "no" to the American military influence that the principal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="768"> To build an economy based on knowledge thanks to oil is perfectly possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="769"> For instance, as the majority of the States of the South, was on the decline. </SEG> 
<SEG id="770"> Even with the income of oil, the flow of dollars in the economy, in itself, is not enough to prosperity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="771"> The groups has therefore decided to devote an education. </SEG> 
<SEG id="772"> Today, this allocation is almost equal to that of the university of thanks, and universities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="773"> It has been a local almost disappeared from the shores. </SEG> 
<SEG id="774"> The centres of research and shaken in Texas, telecommunications. </SEG> 
<SEG id="775"> Although a crisis in the United States, one of the most solid industrial economies in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="776"> It is not right that the same results can be achieved in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="777"> But above all, the Islamic world must rediscover and reconcile itself with its proud of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="778"> The debate on Iraq </SEG> 
<SEG id="779"> None of the countries of the Middle East of Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="780"> The history of war with Iraq of Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional connections with the concern regarding the United States and to their policy in the region: what are the true to its neighbour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="781"> Considering the end with America, Iran is particularly affected by the possibility of a presence continues with its neighbour, so that by the dominant role of America in the construction of the future of Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="782"> Foreign observers can find difficult to follow the internal discussions, yet they exist, they are excessive, even though they are still not visible to the public in general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="783"> They can bring out general approaches in the debate on Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="784"> The Iranian support that will have to cooperate with the United States in Iraq, even if it is to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="785"> For this reason, the refugees should gain the assurance that the new Iraqi leader is not hostile and try to win. </SEG> 
<SEG id="786"> Other considerations relate to the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="787"> These are Moderates who believe that the Iranian government should put pressure on the United States to get the extradition of Members of the organisation of the Members in Iraq, as well as the sum of the organisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="788"> In return, the Iranian government should give its support for the peace, stability and security in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="789"> In short, the boxes, focusing on a programme which largely reflects the concerns of internal refugees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="790"> In general, the Conservative forces in Iran supports this approach. </SEG> 
<SEG id="791"> Another approach in a more active role for the refugees in the reconstruction of Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="792"> The advocates of this or that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction, due to its institutional aspects with Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="793"> Finally, they, the United States and the international Community will recognise the value of cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="794"> The benefits should be rewarded by the dismantling of the recognition of an Iranian 85, so that the Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="795"> Above all, Iran should invite the Americans to respond to its cooperation with the protection of a guarantee in return that Iran does not develop in the future the target of American military actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="796"> In short, the defenders of the benefits of an open call an open market and reason: the support of Iran to ensure stability during the phase of transition stage of its commitment to maintain relations of cooperation with all of the improvement of the regional and international position of Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="797"> This position is widely shared within the movements in Iran, within and outside of the government, as well as by the ruling technocratic and decision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="798"> Finally, for the Group of the European radical Alliance, the possibility of cooperation with the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="799"> They are convinced that America seeks only to undermine the security and to endanger its national interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="800"> According to this, the United States for the important changes to the Iranian foreign policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="801"> At worst, the opposition to impose a change of regime in Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="802"> It with enthusiasm against the acquisition of knowledge and of nuclear energy by Iran and could even trying to weaken the military capacity of Iran in its entirety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="803"> The radical receive the American invasion of Iraq as the image of the American. </SEG> 
<SEG id="804"> In return, they believe that Iran must adopt a position in the defence of its own interests, by forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the influence of the government in Iraq in order to prevent the formation of a government and to Baghdad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="805"> The supporters of the hard line of all of this approach. </SEG> 
<SEG id="806"> The removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime was that the Iraqi crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="807"> The point to make: to establish peace and security, to win the war against terrorism and to convince the Muslim masses that America does not intend to deal with Iraq for the departure of the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="808"> Since then, the opposition against the United States, under the expression of suicide bombings in the groups or other forms of terrorism, will probably only grow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="809"> Iran is intended to keep its position position in the region thanks to his political dynamism and its knowledge in the Muslim world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="810"> What is happening in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the United States would do well to find a means of recognising this fact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="811"> The American threats, or the discussions on another war, feed resentment and in Iran, in the most radical movements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="812"> If the United States wish to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence of its own confidence that the American interests in Iraq are better defended through cooperation with Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="813"> A solution to the Iraq </SEG> 
<SEG id="814"> The situation in Iraq is coming to the point where all of the army, the same thing: the departure of the coalition forces. </SEG> 
<SEG id="815"> In the North of Iraq from the Ministry of defence on the withdrawal of troops on this aspiration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="816"> The only question is how the meeting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="817"> So that the forces of the coalition forces, the violence will only increase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="818"> However, if they leave, the escalation of violence will take place, and even more quickly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="819"> The real question is how we can succeed in Iraq to organise an army and police to which they can make us to respect the law and order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="820"> There is still a long way to go to approach this goal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="821"> Despite the absence of which join the ranks of the police and the army, corporation accounts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="822"> In the North of Iraq, and the situation of ethnic is introduced in certain areas of the district,. </SEG> 
<SEG id="823"> In other areas, the Sharia is imposed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="824"> How can Iraq to create bodies likely to enforce the law with efficiency and fairness, irrespective of race, religion or kind? </SEG> 
<SEG id="825"> The peace and unity, and ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="826"> But the lack of time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="827"> It is necessary to find other means. </SEG> 
<SEG id="828"> In the absence of a system of deeply anchored in the civil society, in which the police and the army soldiers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="829"> They could take various forms, but the most important thing is that they are actually and at local level, and that they have the support of the authorities in the region, the region and country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="830"> If a Community is put in place, and recognized at national level, while the majority of Members of the military and police forces, and in the case of the opposite, it will be easier to identify and of the systems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="831"> Such measures can appear excessively optimistic, and yet, in Afghanistan, a country which looks to the results, many groups work well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="832"> The peace and unity () on a model of the way of operating. </SEG> 
<SEG id="833"> In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="834"> The uniformly in all the countries in the course of the last three years to put in place of the Committee of the regions, supported by the advice of satellites in the villages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="835"> This initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply perception that the children, at a time, while offering the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="836"> The committees have therefore tried to gather all the groups of the Community, in particular the teachers, the religious leaders, the religious leaders, women, the police, the judges and the thousands of businesses, to devise ways to resolve the conflicts without violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="837"> Even if the British worked at present (this is provided for in the future, the simple fact that the police, the army, and justice in our part of the places in contact with the rest of the Community, because the return of information, and to contribute to the establishment of relations of trust. </SEG> 
<SEG id="838"> Some results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="839"> In one of the risks, the local came across some hours and hours, has done throughout the week. </SEG> 
<SEG id="840"> It is necessary for its past and and is committed to disarm his private army of 2 000 men. </SEG> 
<SEG id="841"> It makes today regular visits to the Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="842"> In Iraq, projects such as the current system of production, to carry out a function of monitoring by giving to the population in the various ethnic groups the opportunity to State its complaints and obtain a help to resolve its problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="843"> But, all too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment is not applied for the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="844"> The us and British forces were already well worked to strengthen civil society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="845"> However, we do not intend to talk about the risks of emancipation of women, or of the success of the organisation of local elections on a small scale in the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="846"> Mobilising civil society represents an enormous challenge, particularly when, as in Iraq, it must be made quickly and on a large scale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="847"> The military forces are still needed, but just as much as the encouragement to disarmament, which can take the form of constitute a crime and the attack. </SEG> 
<SEG id="848"> Fortunately, such an organisation of civil society is also very expensive as important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="849"> Under the current system at all for an annual cost of 50 000 to us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="850"> With 10 million dollars, they could put in place a hundred centres of the same type, and it will remain of the currency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="851"> It is now a question of engaging in this direction, demanded that the names of the government in power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="852"> In this, the Iraqi people risk of not knowing the security which it has desperately need after so many years of suffering. </SEG> 
<SEG id="853"> Democracy on the? </SEG> 
<SEG id="854"> The decision surprise President Mubarak of allowing a constitutional amendment allowing the behaviour of presidential elections as a step forward for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="855"> The ways used to a pluralist democracy can have major step in to military for more than 50 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="856"> Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can only be on the agenda of a day of every six years to say yes or no to the single name appears on the presidential elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="857"> This explains why went has always received more than 90% of the vote, although in the Middle of a genius. </SEG> 
<SEG id="858"> The strong men, and this system, without doubt because they have demanded that the names and the voters are placed at the bottom of each one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="859"> Several support for the Middle East and in the Middle East that is engaged in the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="860"> The really could not actually get involved on a process of democratization without first amending its Constitution, in order to reduce the powers of its President and limiting the length of his term of office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="861"> Mubarak, after all, in his capacity as President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="862"> Thus, its announcement of presidential elections to constitute a first major step. </SEG> 
<SEG id="863"> The system can assume that it will be in a position to use the process to its advantage, but events might be more difficult to monitor that provided for a time that the citizens will begin in January. </SEG> 
<SEG id="864"> The arbitrary out of the bottle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="865"> In any case, is not the only country in this region on the road to democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="866"> The Turkey of one side of the Middle East and the regional engaged in this process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="867"> The actual seems to the positive results of the recent elections that were held in Iraq, in Palestine and, to a lesser degree, in Saudi Arabia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="868"> The demonstrations against the occupation of Lebanon by the following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq, Minister. </SEG> 
<SEG id="869"> The combination of more and more courageous and other forms of civil disobedience in the course of the last few weeks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="870"> It is a matter of the arrest and imprisonment of the leader of the opposition leader Ayman Nour, at the end of January. </SEG> 
<SEG id="871"> The arbitrary attitude of the government, but that means "), which has arisen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="872"> Suddenly, the time and are not afraid of 96. </SEG> 
<SEG id="873"> An Alliance of local, regional and international army against the dictatorship. </SEG> 
<SEG id="874"> The recent wave of pressure on seems to have shaken the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="875"> Only a month before,, the demands of constitutional reform in the five ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="876"> But, whatever the combination of events which has brought this turnaround, the initiative relating to the elections must be well received. </SEG> 
<SEG id="877"> It is a first necessary step, although insufficient, to alter the political system of Egypt. </SEG> 
<SEG id="878"> The distrust already, in which the President Zine El bin, which deals with its government for a long time, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment which has appeared to open the way to competitive presidential elections, but which has subsequently led to a ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="879"> During the previous implemented, President, 99% of votes; it has now got 96%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="880"> Arisen is more serious with regard to the electoral reform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="881"> To prove his sincerity, it must order the immediate release of Dr Ayman Nour and take action to put an end to the State of emergency of 24 years, which prevents the success of the organisation of political campaigns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="882"> Mubarak must also approve a limit of 7 of five years for every President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="883"> Just as necessary, of measures intended to gain the trust of the citizens, an open and equal access to the media, which are currently being controlled by the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="884"> I announced that I had intended to dispute this presidential election to come in order to open the debate on these essential reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="885"> But I will return to my life of my life when I have the assurance of a free and open next autumn. </SEG> 
<SEG id="886"> If they are implemented, in effect, these steps equitable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="887"> With the events in Lebanon, in Iraq and in Palestine, they could very well spring of freedom, has for a long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="888"> These elections for? </SEG> 
<SEG id="889"> The Members to go to the ballot boxes to elect a President of the independent, in power for 24 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="890"> So little doubt that it will be re-elected to the outcome of the elections with passion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="891"> It is a national election observers have been made for the occasion, and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week. </SEG> 
<SEG id="892"> Although all the signs of a real electoral are put in place, it is striking that a number of signals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="893"> Despite the promises, are far from being fair. </SEG> 
<SEG id="894"> This is a number of advantages: the recognition of the name, a virtual electronic media controlled by the State, and nothing less than 85%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="895"> A week before the voting, some countries which have not yet had the opportunity to broadcast a single country to the television. </SEG> 
<SEG id="896"> All the Members of the Commission to convince, and the new rules passed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="897"> Since 2000, a Supreme Court decision stipulates that the 8 000 judges referendum must supervise elections, and also the results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="898"> It is a big step towards more fair elections, as the foundation of the judges in the course of the last century of control on the executive power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="899"> The regime has therefore had to use various conviction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="900"> One of them was to stretch the definition of "judicial" to include thousands of employees, the Court but stick to tomorrow, because if they are protesting, because their work of observation, the task is going to return once more to the police to the Ministry of the Interior. </SEG> 
<SEG id="901"> Thus, in the past, the Union has acquitted itself of its task, with foreseeable results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="902"> During the parliamentary elections of 2000, while the Party in power and has accepted that approximately 38% of the votes in the areas affected by the judges, the results achieved to 86% have succeeded in the observation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="903"> This year will be very different. </SEG> 
<SEG id="904"> In spring, held a meeting of an Assembly that unless the government does not grant a complete independence and the process of the elections, they would not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="905"> On 2 September, they have stated their ultimate requirement: the system must allow groups, to observe the elections, to stop to amend the definition of judges in a legitimate purpose results, and that no ballot leaves the presence of a judge that without that its content is expected, certified and deferred. </SEG> 
<SEG id="906"> For the moment it seems that the situation is desperate, as the head of the electoral Commission itself has announced publicly to the public that it by the citizens of the conduct of the elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="907"> Among the interesting developments, on the eve of voting, represents a public debate on the subject: it is necessary to boycott the election or going to vote? </SEG> 
<SEG id="908"> Many opposition parties have called their Members to abstain to protest against the American restrictive rules that strongly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="909"> Moreover, the Muslim brotherhood, regarded as the only Group of opposition having weight, to maintain their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any "despotic and corrupt." </SEG> 
<SEG id="910"> It is an implicit but but clearly, the head of State for 24 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="911"> Some part of the civil society organisations thousands of young to monitor the elections, despite the objections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="912"> These groups argue that if the system is not the intention of the elections in Ukraine, then the presence of national and international observers should not pose a problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="913"> The reply is to say that any external monitoring is an interference in the sovereignty, and that national and an insult to the integrity of the judges. </SEG> 
<SEG id="914"> This argument is quickly dropped when the European Union is pronounced itself in favour of the civil society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="915"> The system of voices from inside and outside that the challenge to hold free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to abolish the cheats within the Party, so it is in its operation, the signs are not bode well with regard to the polls next Wednesday. </SEG> 
<SEG id="916"> In the meantime, for the first time the make the exciting challenge to the dictatorship, and use of a whole new area of freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="917"> The European </SEG> 
<SEG id="918"> The increased can play a pivotal role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political disputes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="919"> When that happens, the commercial transactions are becoming more difficult and subject to a greater uncertainty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="920"> The money at the time of the economically devastating. </SEG> 
<SEG id="921"> But violent wars have proceeded more recently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="922"> In the course of the years, has become the subject of a political conflict persisted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="923"> Every originator had theories and explanations significantly different on the situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="924"> The Europeans, and particularly the French, complained that the general Charles de Gaulle privilege of the American dollar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="925"> The general and his,, Jacques, that the United States the status of the Statute of the system of fixed exchange rate in order to manage the deficits and to pay in order to abroad (at this time in Vietnam). </SEG> 
<SEG id="926"> France has reacted in a monetary reform that would put an end to the particular role and has tried to revive now largely discredited. </SEG> 
<SEG id="927"> The Europeans have started a long discussion on the advantages of monetary Union, the implementation of which would allow them to compete with the dollar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="928"> But from the point of view of the international role was a trap. </SEG> 
<SEG id="929"> Other countries could change their exchange rates and thus able to support a greater competition at the level of exports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="930"> The American government has revealed a yen, feeding the belief that the rest of the world on the basis of production of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="931"> The administration has concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to get involved in a monetary Union (a monetary and that the other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates). </SEG> 
<SEG id="932"> These battles forgotten side suddenly seem very present again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="933"> The world has more of a system of fixed exchange rate, but the dollar remains the currency of the, a sort of reserve,. </SEG> 
<SEG id="934"> For example, the role of the dollar constitutes a potential threat to the Americans, it would be rather another example of American hegemony. </SEG> 
<SEG id="935"> In the course of this decade, China has taken the place of the 1960s, preventing its exchange rates of up to push the growth of exports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="936"> It has made of it in particular American relating to unfair competition and to efforts to impose an adjustment of the exchange rate to dissuade the Americans to buy toys, and Chinese clothing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="937"> The American manufacturers have thought that the throats made in China threatened the American way of life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="938"> Meanwhile, the Europeans (and particularly the French) enormous, and the argument that the rest of the rest of the world is paying for the wars of America is back in fashion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="939"> Some European suggest that the Central banks should hold a large number of their reserves in euros, an ECHO of fruitless try to summarise the American dollar against trafficking of gold. </SEG> 
<SEG id="940"> The declaration by the collapse of the system and by a major financial, accompanied by a price of goods. </SEG> 
<SEG id="941"> Everyone has been affected and the role on the world stage has been undermined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="942"> A similar collapse at the present time should have an effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="943"> The system of floating rate that is more stable and the costs of distributed differently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="944"> The majority of Americans do not suffer from the value of the dollar must proceed to adjustments to the American market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="945"> The Asian economies and their themselves and their Central banks lean on the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="946"> They should pursue this policy not to see their areas of use to undergo a sudden failure on the American market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="947"> The United States will have time to deal with a deficit of security which not sustainable in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="948"> The economically dynamic world (North America and Asia) are well secured by a Pact that will ensure the continuity of the American dollar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="949"> The Americans will continue to build the number of debt for them there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="950"> The abolition of the Pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="951"> It is not a question of a post for the Pact involves cooperation with Asia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="952"> But for the Europeans, who are excluded from the stability Pact, this Conference in a monetary and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="953"> Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the value from the European industrial exporters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="954"> Europe is not, however, in a position of the ease. </SEG> 
<SEG id="955"> Europe is in fact the largest of the new currency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="956"> The responses in the 1960s (recovery of the gold standard or creation of a common European currency) do not seem to be very useful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="957"> A single currency has not allowed us to bring a consistent protection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="958"> The former version of the European reaction (the desire called "the desire of the") ”. </SEG> 
<SEG id="959"> The European Central Bank will be invited to extend the basis of monetary Union, as if the imitation of the dollar is the answer to all the problems of industrial, structural and economic which pervade Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="960"> But we should remember that the problems of Europe does not stem from the manipulation of currencies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="961"> The protests against the new version of the America must be seen for what they are: a means to compensate for a real European powerlessness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="962"> The desire of the dollar is therefore ready to start and it will stress the value of the dollar, international disappearing without causing obviously harmful effects on the people that the print and use it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="963"> An epidemic </SEG> 
<SEG id="964"> The Americans, as the citizens of all the countries of the world, the citizens to accept the fact that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of some sort of public representatives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="965"> Some of us are surprised (although some may be disappointed) when a judge or a senior is appointed because it has achieved a test at an important principle in the eyes of the Party, or from the Prime Minister. </SEG> 
<SEG id="966"> But the science, in the opinion of all, occupies a place in part and on this point, the United States, to serve as an example of warning to the rest of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="967"> The scientific nominations must be based on objective criteria of training, expertise and performance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="968"> Clearly, it is legitimate to question to the health and services (of) on its views on abortion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="969"> But it is completely inappropriate to submit the scientific scientific advisory committees in totally. </SEG> 
<SEG id="970"> Similarly, the membership at the scientific proposals, a process which is fundamental to the scientific progress, should definitely be freed from all the barriers which have nothing to do with the professional qualifications. </SEG> 
<SEG id="971"> Unfortunately, the scientists in the running of more and more often in these barriers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="972"> In the course of the last autumn, the magazine published several reports on the matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="973"> One of these reports concerned on the replacement of the price of the Members of the advisory Committee of the national centre for health protection, which is part of the centre for disease prevention and control (CDC), without prior consultation of the director of the centre. </SEG> 
<SEG id="974"> Similar cases have also been observed in the advisory Committee on the CDC, the advisory Committee on national protection and the advisory Committee on testing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="975"> The current ideology, in which the advisory committees are then reformed with new Member States, and where the candidates are subject to extensive of honesty, seems dangerous to the countryside. </SEG> 
<SEG id="976"> The representatives of the referred to as a "practice equitably. </SEG> 
<SEG id="977"> It is not a question of a practice in America, or at least not up to now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="978"> In any case, the fact that the Bush administration itself tests candidates to posts in order to determine their compatibility with its' values' is not really worrying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="979"> The most alarming development on the degree of importance, which interfere in areas previously against this kind of manipulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="980"> In fact, the case of revealing in this present epidemic has concerned the modification of the membership of the section of the study of the safety and health, which evaluates the subsidies granted to the study of the injuries on the place of work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="981"> The advisory committees could be vulnerable to a revision of this type in the past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="982"> After all, they have policies that take or no consideration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="983"> But the sections of study? </SEG> 
<SEG id="984"> In October 2002, science has published an Article of David and some of his colleagues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="985"> Some of them were having taken part having participated in some of the committees concerned, and they have made a point of view is the issue, based on their personal experience. </SEG> 
<SEG id="986"> Item constituted a matter in itself, but the consequences it has even more interesting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="987"> It has triggered a flight of letters in which the scientists similar experiences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="988"> A candidate for the coordinating Committee of the national Institute of health has told that an investigation had been taken on it by a Member of the White House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="989"> After having been invited to recall its opinions on the various policies of the Bush administration, which none of it had links with the work of the Committee, it has had to say if it if the policy of President on embryonic stem cells. </SEG> 
<SEG id="990"> Another person to be shown, a distinguished Professor in psychiatry and psychology related to have received an appeal from the White House concerning his appointment in Council on drug abuse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="991"> His speaker has declared that it had to make a survey on it in order to "to determine if its opinions could the President '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="992"> According to Professor, a series of questions is followed, the representative of the White House holding a chip. </SEG> 
<SEG id="993"> Example: 'you have two out of three; the President is opposed to the exchange of the for the users of drugs, for ethical reasons, whatever the result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="994"> Then the dialogue has taken a turn even more alarming. </SEG> 
<SEG id="995"> The representative has requested, if it had voted for, and, after having received a negative answer, it has asked: 'why did you not supported President? " </SEG> 
<SEG id="996"> This attitude is a dictatorship, and not in a democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="997"> The objective is to bring the scientific advisory committees is and reflected in the political process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="998"> There is nothing to stop, and much to lose, as a result of the desired policy is put forward. </SEG> 
<SEG id="999"> This is the reason why the determination of research projects to support has always been a matter of having to be examined by the by, and not by politicians. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1000"> In fact, the law that applies here (the law on the federal advisory committees, the advisory Committee requires that the committees are uncommitted and not an inappropriate of an ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1001"> The American Secretary to health and to the President and the Bureau of the White House should set an example to the rest of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1002"> They can very easily: while respecting the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1003"> People in Moscow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1004"> It is time to put an end to the myth that the "with" Vladimir Putin has made the law in a somewhat more respectful of laws. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1005"> The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, journalists among the best and most courageous of Russia, a woman who dared to put the brutal murders committed by the Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that the President Putin runs a dictatorship and contempt in respect of the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1006"> It is time for the rest of the world, particularly for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1007"> The German Ministry of foreign Affairs of a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify the lack of respect for the law to the national interest of the most powerful Member of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1008"> But the indifference of the conciliation when it encourages people to continue in this way in the international arena, as to pursue its campaign aiming to present it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1009"> The murder of a taste of: just as during the days of glory, in Russia and the people disappear, quite simply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1010"> The assassination of the instrument is the third in three weeks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1011"> Ziganshin hurry, was killed by a bullet to 30 September of this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1012"> Kozlov, vice of the Central Bank of Russia, which has led to a campaign against the financial fraud, has been murdered on 14 September. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1013"> The fact that the general Prosecutor of Russia on the investigation into the murder in hand, as it has done for one, as it is not a source of hope, as this would be the case in a real democracy if a case in which an inquiry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1014"> In fact, a involvement of higher levels of government in Russia is an assurance that the murderer will never be found. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1015"> The murder is a particularly sinister when one considers the fact that she virulent criticisms in the place of the Russian President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1016"> In its articles on one of the few independent newspapers,, and in its books "Russia: life in a democracy" and "a dirty war: a Russian journalist in Chechnya" commented on the abolition of the four freedoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1017"> As the fate of the exiled Boris "and", and that the risk of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of the enemies of people can take three forms: the exile, the us or the grave. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1018"> I am not accusing the government can have ordered the killing of credit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1019"> After all, both that of investigation, she has not many other people, of which the current Prime Minister in addition to is not least, that it is to lead to a marked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1020"> But even if the partners of Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the murder by bullet with the building of Moscow, regardless of the law has created a climate in which the law has been perpetrated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1021"> The picture of the murder of in its cathedral in many centuries ago, the crime has been committed with the conviction that the King would be happy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1022"> Given that represented the responsibility of a democratic press of calling into question the Kremlin and its policies - the government would have to ensure that it does not arrive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1023"> Russia has already lost 12 distinguished journalists, murdered in the course of the past six years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1024"> None of these crimes have been clarified, this would not be the case if the "with", was something other than a single public relations strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1025"> The six years that have passed since the arrival of Vladimir Putin, have been marked by deeply contradictory signals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1026"> On the one hand, the world sees a young leader qualified to modernise the Russia, and particularly to the application of the law and the judicial practices on the international standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1027"> On the other hand, the President of a contents of saying nothing while its former colleagues services of security structures of the former KGB) protect absolutely not those who kill, and even launch a series of business, and even against journalists, scientists and environmental activists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1028"> Among these Gregori Pasko controls, the control of arms, the diplomatic Valentin, these ", and many others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1029"> The civilising influence that involves the fact of being a partner, chairing a G8 Summit at the lowest, for example, not to count for anything in the Kremlin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1030"> Once again, the contact with the values of the West has given birth to another of laws and rules of law and of democratic rules, but are the same justified that make the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1031"> At world level, the danger is that the failure of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1032"> Near borders, a form of form is taking root. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1033"> Think of the way in which has attempted to rig the elections in Ukraine, and to your duties without charges against the leader of the opposition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1034"> Consider the secessionist regions playing in Moldova and Georgia, who only exist because they have the support of the Kremlin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1035"> Look as if seeks to sing its neighbours by threatening their energy supplies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1036"> All the police means that when they ignore the criminals, become more audacious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1037"> It is high time that the world political Europe for what it is: a man who brings outside the country from the shadows. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1038"> The world must be able this old Latin maxim which does not do not say, and to ask whether it is really wise to agree to the construction of a superpower and where the law does not count. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1039"> A gas pipeline to Russia </SEG> 
<SEG id="1040"> Gerhard Schröder, less than a month ago, was still German Chancellor has agreed to become President of the President of the company in a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany across the Baltic sea and the Western Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1041"> In many countries, one would be the offence of conflict of interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1042"> Its apparent failure there is exacerbated by the fact that at the same time, the threat to stop the supply of gas, and if it does not give in to the requirements of the Kremlin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1043"> The strategic objective of Russia is evident, not of gas in the Ukraine also means that a good part of Europe will be more Europe, because the majority of be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1044"> In Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic States, the new will influence, which seeks to impose in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1045"> The President Vladimir Putin and his government of the will no longer need to worry about the reactions of Western Europe when they decide when they put pressure on Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1046"> Europe should actually be of such a weapon?? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1047"> Worse still, Russia must use this weapon for the EU to put the EU? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1048"> A former German Chancellor on the management of the company that will provide the means to manipulate the European economy testifies to the dangerous of Europe in view of President Putin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1049"> Of course, the media are aware of the dependence of the reports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1050"> They go to enjoy structures have written 'when we have put our trade with Europe, it will keep silent on the issue of human rights.' </SEG> 
<SEG id="1051"> In this way oblique committing to follow what he called a 'independence'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1052"> Thus, he simply say that Russia must remain independent democracies regarding the ethical and human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1053"> It may be that some European leaders believe indeed that the maintenance of the of the EU in that they are silent on the issue of human rights and the other topics which upset the Kremlin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1054"> Of course, we must express ourselves on the questions on the ", as the expropriation of expropriation. however, if the Kremlin came to cash our values and our critical attitude to his respect - as about - it would seem that the Europeans, that will rise in prices or even a blockade, such as the one which is currently faced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1055"> While at the same time its course, in submitting its will, the hopes of the EU to see Russia become more and more and more should be abandoned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1056"> Russia, is in the process of building is gradually transformed it has abandoned its hopes to become the new elite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1057"> In fact, the director of the gas pipeline is a friend of a friend. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1058"> A little earlier in the year, the wall street Journal that the director, the director of the power of the Bank, is an officer of the police, the former East Germany, and that it is, at the end of the 1980s when the Russian President was the structures in the GDR. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1059"> The risk that a government made up of the KGB, for whom the lack of sympathy and lack of the rule, reflects the last twenty years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1060"> Now, the estimates that what is good for the Russians foundation is also for the citizens of independent Nations. pity will be granted to small countries to a time that Russia means to intimidate, isolate and energy blockade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1061"> As a former head of State of the new, independent, I have often been confronted with such threats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1062"> The European Union has signed agreements with Russia, including concerning a common area of freedom and justice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1063"> The Kremlin is very much for to such a idealism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1064"> Its control on Eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of ‘ a friendship "and the invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia were. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1065"> But please, how can this gap "common": a barbaric treatment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the harassment and the prosecution of the Orange revolution, the Orange revolution, completely invented. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1066"> If the Europeans really believe in their common area of human rights and freedoms, they must Nevertheless acknowledge that these values are not shared by men. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1067"> It is also for this which is to consider Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1068"> Is it really the ‘ red terror ’, countless, of the Soviet era and the Soviet era of the may indeed help to combat the threat to fight the Iran and North Korea? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1069"> It seems likely that the minds but the content of exploiting every crisis to increase their power of destruction and their influence. </SEG>

<SEG id="1072"> We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learnt from our history that behind every act of Russia hides a?). </SEG>

<SEG id="1082"> It follows that girls are also adults in view of the criminal law, and the death penalty, for example, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1083"> The can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected Parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are entitled to determine the 'laws' of Islam. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1084"> The foreigners and some Liberals concerned especially that this clause, but the opposition to the Constitution, widely spread to the East, which other provisions: the exclusion of the "of political life and government, and from the government, and to 18, and allow them to join. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1085"> The law of exclusion is a problem for the East, which consist of thousands of men, Liberals, even of artists, who, with a few exceptions, were all Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1086"> In theory, the constitutional ban might not be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1087"> But in practice, the laws are implemented in order to exclude the Members saying "high ranking" of any form of employment in the government, which concerns thousands of people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1088"> The accept without doubt the provisions if they do not apply to the Kurds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1089"> They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but the secession of the three Kurdish, to form an independent, with its own Ministry of finance, his army), and its production of its production of Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1090"> The reject this same federalism for because they consider as of the elements which have always accepted the law which in the past and which will again, unless they have their own government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1091"> It is this that the new Constitution, because the southern provinces - which have the most important reserves of oil - in their own could form their own regional government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1092"> In the Middle East, the Middle East and and leaders of the Constitution with the use of violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1093"> But the federalism is not the only reason for which the supporters of the lethal attacks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1094"> Their opposition is more: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1095"> Instead, they seek to restore the impression of the minority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1096"> For the Islamists, as at the death of all,. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1097"> A Shiite leader, present, as compared with the federalism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1098"> Its supporters, in large part, are the poorest and most of the shanty towns and beyond, which the militia mahdi "has fought the American troops in 2004, even while the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1099"> As my priest deriving its authority of his father, a populist died Ayatollah itself, must confront the opposition living, despise his ignorance and its violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1100"> Present absolutely cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority, it chooses therefore take a decision against them, often saying that the highest or concern, Ayatollah, is not the but Persia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1101"> In the same way, he says in his supporters that the real aim, which the Supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq () and their militia "", "ones in Iran, which many of which a lot, up to what the Americans' back." </SEG> 
<SEG id="1102"> If the present federalism because a government to follow in its enemies, and in the EU, and, as he says, under the aegis of the government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1103"> To highlight its message, has sent its men or the militia, with success in Baghdad, where the agricultural, but not in Najaf, where is after the destruction that it has caused last year until his men are slaughtered by the Americans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1104"> It was already quite difficult to cope with the present enough. at present, a simple political calculation that to think that it will without doubt the main character to decide the outcome of the vote of the Constitution of October. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1105"> For rejecting the Constitution and bring new elections of a constitutional Assembly, would have need of a majority of two thirds in at least three provinces. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1106"> The East are likely to take that in two provinces, but if orders to its supporters of the vote not with the local, that will no doubt - the accidents in the hands of the opponents of the Constitution and ensure its defeat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1107"> All political, is of course to sell. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1108"> Last year it was sought to murder. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1109"> Today it seeks a recognition as a man, he wants the money, and, at least implicitly, humiliation and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1110"> It can accept the proposals, and the negotiations have perhaps already started. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1111"> But some of the attacks that it with words and thousands of thousands of armed men at their disposal and for them, it is worth only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1112"> The end of culture </SEG> 
<SEG id="1113"> Transparency is not always an easy in the new democracies of Eastern Europe, and it is this that has brought the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc, when a, in which his government has triggered riots. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1114"> As Hungary, Romania has tried to encourage the opening and fairness in a society which has more closed in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1115"> But the persistence of a culture of secrecy has caused the corruption and the abuse of power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1116"> One remark, however, a genuine evolution towards more transparency, both recognised by the European Union which has given the Green light to Romania for membership at the beginning of the year 2007. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1117"> Besides the putting in place of what the EU stands today for a functioning market economy ", essential reforms in the area of political and judicial, of which I am responsible, transparency and strengthening the transparency and control of the funding of political parties in the reorganisation of the judicial system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1118"> The judicial reforms contribute to root out corruption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1119"> Ministers and former Ministers, Members of Parliament, magistrates, lawyers, and Members of the police, customs and other public bodies, as well as private businesses, have been charged. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1120"> Furthermore, new forms have been placed at the point to the declarations of assets and financial interests by persons taking, to the government, in Parliament, in the public administration and threats and in the judicial system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1121"> The new methods of declaration are detailed in Europe, and, above all, they are made public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1122"> The progress of this is confirmed by a report published this month, according to which the citizens of Eastern Europe have access to information, as well as those of democracies laid down in advance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1123"> The report transparency and business, of the open society justice (available on), indicates that the new democracies are sometimes better than the old: some governmental bodies reply further to the demands of information of citizens that their French or Spanish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1124"> More specifically, 60% of demands are met in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1125"> Among the other two students, they can good and Mexico, two countries that have adopted legislation relating to the freedom of information in 2002, shortly after the Romania. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1126"> However, it is not always easy access to sensitive information in the democracies in transition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1127"> I have worked for the defence of human rights within the Committee, and we have often had to take effect to demand the communication of information, by virtue of the Romanian law of 2001 for the freedom of information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1128"> For example, when we have formally obtaining access to data on the telephone tapping authorised by the Prosecutor, it has simply ignored this decision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1129"> We have tackled at the treatment, and the judge has set a penalty for every day of delay in the communication of information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1130"> It is only when the media are interested in the matter, together - that the number of authorised during the previous ten years, people concerned and duration of operations - have been made public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1131"> Romania has Finally started to turn back to a marked by the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1132"> I am now part of the government, and I am aware that it is not always obvious share certain information with the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1133"> But it happens that painful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1134"> We would not have led to the economic and political reforms that will allow us to enter into the EU without subjecting our policies to the examination of the public and accept the increased participation of citizens in the decision-making process which accompanies inevitably such an open. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1135"> In fact, the access to the information became a condition sine qua non of democracy throughout the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1136"> When the United States has adopted the freedom of information act in 1966, they were the ones, with Sweden and Finland. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1137"> Today, are acquired such legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1138"> In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on the freedom of information in the full part. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1139"> According to the study of the justice, which is aimed at the Romanian government to receive without great difficulty, that it would have been unthinkable to announce some years ago. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1140"> Thus, the German government of the defence has disclosed the number of deaths in 2003, so that the circumstances (notably 13 expression, two deaths by ball, and two deaths in fighting in Afghanistan). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1141"> Another example, the Court of Bucharest has received a request concerning the number of judges have been the subject of a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of the year 2000, and the motives of sanctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1142"> The Court has forwarded this request to the Council, which has given a full reply: four pages listing all the European punished, the preamble and the measures taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1143"> This process is at the same time and the driving force of the pursuit of reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1144"> The governments have not always been very comfortable with the open, and this continues to be the most sensitive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1145"> But in the former Communist countries, the benefits of transparency are indisputable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1146"> However, the experience of Romania shows that the peace is still a threat, that no country is in the enclave, and that only a vigilance of all in can prevent undermining the foundations of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1147"> To save the trees </SEG> 
<SEG id="1148"> Nobody can in its day without having used a product derived from the forest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1149"> In a much more important that they do not, the Paper on which it is written, the water which flows from our drugs that we, the requirements which our homes and our are all of the forest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1150"> When we give fresh air that we breathe and shelter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1151"> They give us also places, which is becoming ever more important in the complexity of our world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1152"> Approximately 1.5 billion people living in rural areas rural zones of forests for their basic needs in feed and food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1153"> However, the deforestation is continuing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1154"> Every year, we lose million hectares of forest, is an area of great big that four times the Switzerland. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1155"> When the management of forests, accentuated by regulations and obligations, too weak, and the markets which reward everyone all to deprive the world more and more threatened. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1156"> When the already begin to disappear, a whole set of problems of environmental, social and economic problems, which affect us all in one way or another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1157"> The island of disappearance in Indonesia is a good example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1158"> The firms and papers undertake a an endemic and destruction that the greater diversity of species of plants in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1159"> It is very likely that still remain in the process as such in and the disappearance, as well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1160"> When the disappearance of whole communities will have disappeared, they also places of decent life or no means they earn their living. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1161"> Moreover, the distortion that the illegal trade in products and products and products at the world markets is cause difficulties for the responsible citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1162"> The developing countries are losing 15 thousand million every year due to illegal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1163"> The whole, the request for the reconstruction following the tsunami of last year, has intensified a request an already unbearable Sumatra. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1164"> The basins of the Amazon and are the subject of similar threats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1165"> A recent study of the United Nations, the United Nations for the Millennium (), shows that the forests and other regions shows that a serious decline due to their poor management and continue to disappear if measures to put in place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1166"> The information published by the Brazilian government shows that the forests and irreplaceable up, in fact, reached 2.6 million hectares of last year, which concerns the sum of the zone of deforestation of the 17%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1167"> However, the battle against deforestation is not yet lost. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1168"> Various organisations, movements and businesses concerned of the State of the world work together to bring the phenomenon of deforestation and to improve the management of forests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1169"> Thus, for example, the WWF (the world wildlife Fund) and the world Bank have helped the Brazilian government to launch an initiative intended to establish new areas of forest protection on 17 million hectares in the form of national parks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1170"> The cooperation of the world Bank has also motivated to establish a trust Fund for managing these. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1171"> Similarly, a meeting at the top of the leaders of the countries of the Mediterranean basin and has enabled a cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their cooperation for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1172"> All this has led to the releasing of USD 53 million from the department of State of the United States to promote the conservation of forests in the Congo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1173"> Since the first meeting in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas have been protected in the Congo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1174"> However, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami last December, the weight of arguments provided by the statistics on the regions and others, we must pursue our efforts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1175"> The world Bank and the world wildlife Fund have recently promised to work to the reduction of the rate of 10% of worldwide for 2010 and work with the public and private sectors so as to enable the achievements in forests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1176"> The studies of the point that if the forests worldwide are divided between different uses, of which the protection of certain areas, the commercial management for the restoration of landscapes, we shall provide the needs in forest products while preserving the environmental and social closer to our future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1177"> The leaders of businesses, the governments, the organisations of civil society must all play their part in the implementation of this vision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1178"> The citizens? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1179"> The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia and much to calling into question the prospects for survival of the House reigning and on the question of whether the UK is basically and destroying or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1180"> For one reason or another, it seems that the Saudi society of which draws its inspiration in an extreme religious orthodoxy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1181"> The fact that of the 19 who took part in the attacks of 11 September 2001 against the United States were profoundly against the United Kingdom so that perception of the authoritarianism and intolerance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1182"> In some respects, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the population, are in its entirety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1183"> On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to assume that the fanatical defines; the attitudes towards the religion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1184"> Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team to carry out a study on a large scale of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1185"> Our results have produced a picture of attitudes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1186"> By comparison with the people of other countries in the Middle East, out of all the least women in general, and their attitudes towards democracy and the moderate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1187"> It is certain that in the four countries, the other is extended, more than 90% of those questioned in that they believe in God, a life after the dead, and heaven and hell. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1188"> But the citizens seem to be that their causes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1189"> Two hundred were described as religious individuals, 82% of politicians, 85% of 42 and 98%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1190"> The Americans also seem to be more women that were, 81%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1191"> This can be in part by the meaning of the term ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1192"> For example, the Americans can define the meaning of the inhabitants of the countries of the Middle East, with perhaps a less pronounced than in the countries of the Islamic religious beliefs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1193"> This could also give an account of the differences between the Muslim countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1194"> But the gap, between, on the one hand and the politicians, the ones and the other matter inclination, is so great that it flies in the face of the widespread an extremely Conservative and religious Saudi Arabia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1195"> In fact, the actions are more words that the words: only 28% of citizens have declared that they attended to services, 27% of the 27% of politicians, 44% of 42, 44% of the Egyptians and 45% of the Americans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1196"> These conclusions, in contrast to the perceptions of the Saudi culture, are less surprising that they appear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1197"> Sociologists religion or for longer than in an environment or religious, or when the institutions are closely linked to the State, the State of the population decline. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1198"> It is sensible to think that when the authorities of the State must apply rigid, tend to get away from the institutions are formally ratified. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1199"> So it is hardly surprising that the Egyptians and 42, who live in countries in which the State applies, educated or the or the citizens, who have to deal with the policy of which backed by the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1200"> Even on the issue of marriage, many citizens have expressed opinions are Liberal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1201"> The people interviewed were divided on the question of equal way, half of supporting the idea that the marriage must be based on the television, against 48% which, as a basis for the sake of marriage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1202"> In view of the situation of the sexes, this result seems to reveal a deep desire to reveal a more marked in what has been, as always, a decision to training. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1203"> Finally, the departure of eager supporters of democracy, conflicting once again in the conservatism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1204"> On all questioned, 58% democracy as the best form of government that is, 23% were in disagreement and 18% did not understand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1205"> The massive support in favour of democracy in a country without history and nationalist seems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1206"> In fact, the support for democracy, in a number of other Liberal attitudes that we have noted in Saudi Arabia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1207"> The supporters of democracy tend to be less, more tolerant towards others, more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more worried by the more Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1208"> Beyond the personal data, history has shown that the Liberal ideas are becoming more widespread when a despotic monarch rules with the support of an institution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1209"> A strong common appeared at the end of the ninth century in Syria in response to the religious despotism of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1210"> At the same time, a movement secular name has made its appearance in Iran, in reaction to between the and the institution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1211"> In the light of the similarities between these and the actual conditions in Saudi Arabia, we ought not to eliminate the possibility of reform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1212"> The data to suggest that the citizens could very well require a policy more transparent and less a religion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1213"> The European </SEG> 
<SEG id="1214"> At the end of the 19th century, represented for a source of artistic or the target of imperialist ambitions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1215"> Conversely, Europe was a symbol of the region - for the Japanese or decline - for the Chinese. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1216"> A century later, thanks to the Japanese, the Europeans, at least a small part of Asia as a centre of technological and industrial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1217"> Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the perception of Europe and Asia are in the process of change radically, with savings in motion and a European Union in the Middle of the crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1218"> Some major countries, such as the former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, those warnings: if they continue on this path, their continent will soon be of interest to tourism and range. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1219"> A man of influential, which shares his time between Hong Kong and London, has even been more precise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1220"> It has declared a few weeks ago, on the occasion of a concrete demonstration in Paris of political leaders and of big business managers: "you are in the process of becoming the countries of the developing world waste your time with the Constitution, the welfare State, the crisis of the funding of pensions, and answers to the questions that you put". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1221"> The idea that the Europeans are the Asia in general, and, in particular, is more complex it goes to the adaptation of the adaptation to a new competitor, pure and simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1222"> In some French students, came out on the streets to invent a new world of China, a country yet discover in a brutal cultural revolution and senseless. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1223"> This absurd fad was the fruit of both the ignorance of the crimes of the system, that feeling in a prosperous society close to full employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1224"> Today, their heirs criticise capitalist Asia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1225"> China, formerly star at the end of the ultra-liberal than postponed, feared by a new generation of reactionary, defending the status quo in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1226"> The students who have demonstrated recently in the streets and does not want to emulate the Chinese and the Indians; they refuse the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of social benefits hard won. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1227"> The attitude of the European economic is very different. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1228"> They were well understood that their conceptions of nostalgia, according to which China and India would be on the markets and of the market, are obsolete. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1229"> These countries are of real and worthy of respect and admiration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1230"> The quality, the costs and the deadlines - in the car industry, for example - are working to achieve the European level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1231"> Europe still has an advantage in the scientific disciplines, such as the pharmaceutical industry, but of new businesses, especially in India, more and more and more to recruit qualified and and thanks, and - thanks to lower still lower down to remain competitive on a global scale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1232"> Unfortunately, if the European leaders were aware of the challenge of Asia, they have not managed to bring in a lesson of realism, in a context of globalisation irresistible, or in a call to arms in the field of social and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1233"> In fact, the European political leaders, with a few rare exceptions as Tony Blair, too late to adapt to changes in Asia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1234"> Devoid of long-term strategy, and obsessed by interests in the short term, the European politicians - unlike the Heads of businesses - do not have earned the respect of their development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1235"> The fact remains that, on a continent that has not managed to bury the past and to finish with the ghost of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1236"> But this picture can survive in a European? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1237"> For the development, the European model could become a version of the policy of Venice: a place that they regularly with the size of a year, as a marvellous European. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1238"> And blue </SEG> 
<SEG id="1239"> The nomination of Condoleezza rice Secretary of State Powell shows that the results of that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1240"> It is important that the Americans but also, above all, the rest of the world, that these elections reveal of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1241"> The presidential election of this year shows that the American is sound, and that that certain things to be improved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1242"> Contrary to the election of 2000, when President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and in the popular vote, Mr Bush took this time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1243"> Whilst some will remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Mr Bush cannot be called into question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1244"> America is strongly divided between the red, for, and the blue, democratic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1245"> If 100 000 million in the red, John, John Kerry would become President (despite a vote of). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1246"> The vote was incorporated in the American Constitution to protect the small States in the federal system and this involves today that the election campaign will very largely on a dozen at the very most, where the public where public opinion is closely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1247"> Basically, there is something unlikely in the election of Presidents without popular majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1248"> It is therefore time to discuss the amendment of the Community to abolish the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1249"> Some observers rhetoric and good to sow discord that have characterised this campaign. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1250"> It must be appreciated in a historical perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1251"> The founding fathers, the newspapers and easily, appalled by the hardness of the policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1252"> For the most part of its with history, without speaking of the civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was also closely divided than it is today and the bitter rhetoric always reflected this competition between the countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1253"> For all that, in spite of the two sides, the three national debates have raised important questions in a serious format and have been widely format. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1254"> In general, the economic growth of the economic growth has all the opportunities to be re-elected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1255"> In this sense, the true of the re-election of Mr Bush was. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1256"> To a large extent, this is due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1257"> Mr Kerry has tried to turn the war, the low rate of employment creation, the days of taxation and the tax credits of Mr Bush towards the Central questions in the countryside, but some observers have felt that it managed not to send a clear message. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1258"> Mr Bush has been drawn up with the issue of security against terrorism and questions on certain issues such as opposed to abortion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1259"> Finally, the questions and the safety of the economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1260"> The interpretation was influenced by the opinion of out of the voters of (after having voted on the questions that more for them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1261"> The major part (22%) has responded to the moral values ", compared with only 20% have quoted the economy and 19% terrorism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1262"> The social interpreted this as meaning that they had won the election of Mr Bush and that their programme to dominate his second term of office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1263"> However, a survey carried out a week after the election indicated that the category of "moral values espoused a wide range of issues in more rights to abortion and rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1264"> In fact, the opinion polls show that 25% of the 35% are in favour of in favour of couples (position defended Mr Kerry). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1265"> However, for the 37% who are opposed to the particular in particular at the centre of the country, the question of the supporters of Mr Bush to the ballot boxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1266"> That is to say, if the United States are deeply divided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1267"> The development of the red and has given birth on the Internet and on the on the two shores from the centre of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1268"> Call it ‘ côtopie ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1269"> But the divisions are not so. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1270"> In the two camps, many States have been won by a narrow margin and if they cards by county rather than by, the major part of the country turns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1271"> Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation at the place of two heart. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1272"> In fact, the public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans are concentrated in the moderate political spectrum rather than the two extremes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1273"> But the political elite such as the political and the Members of Congress tend to be more than the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1274"> At first glance, it seems that, since they should feel attracted by the centre, a vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1275"> However, many Members of Congress in regions which are obtained at their Party and the real threat to their primary parties, dominated by the two parties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1276"> This trend is reinforced by the television, which attracts the viewers through more controversial, and the draftsmen of the Internet, which throw in out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1277"> A reform which would change the regions, in order to make them more competitive to respond to this problem, but some Members will vote for such changes that could increase the risk of their defeat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1278"> The margin of results suggest that Mr Bush does not really change the mandate that it thinks have won. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1279"> Faced with the difficult questions in the field of foreign policy, fiscal and dociale, it would be wise to turn towards the centre rather than to reconcile its Conservative basis, but the policy which prevails between the policy of belief or pragmatic policy remains unclear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1280"> Let us! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1281"> The German Chancellor has made the fight against global warming the presidencies of the European Union and the European Union which begin in January. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1282"> Its concrete proposal is quite enough for the leaders of the Parliament, and quite clearly that the other governments and businesses understands: at the next G8 Summit, it will quite simply to set a date for a date to which we will no longer be registered in the industrialized countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1283"> This decision will have a considerable impact on the geopolitical and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1284"> Today, the real concern in the matter of energy is not related to the reduction of the world of oil, but rather the decline of the internal production of consumers in Europe, the United States and the United States, at the very moment when the growing demand from Asia carries the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1285"> The supply of funds will concentrate more in the Middle East, as those of other regions of the world will soon to dry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1286"> What is more, the situation of oil are not prepared to submit their policies of investment to market conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1287"> The Saudi Arabia wants to manage alone, and, from its side, Iran had to potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and corruption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1288"> The suffers from a lack of security, whereas the foreigners are placed in every attempt to investment in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1289"> These four contain half of the world ’ s oil reserves, of which two thirds could potentially be exported. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1290"> These factors, except the costs of production, are at the origin of high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and in Central Asia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1291"> The fact of believing that the increase in the price of oil is a good thing for the environment does not take account of international policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1292"> First of all, in the majority of the poor countries of Africa and Asia, the import of oil represent a part of the most important national spending in the industrialised countries, which means that the growth of economic and social development are compromise, and that new crises of debt system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1293"> The application of the production of oil production in the major exporting countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1294"> Thanks to the strengthening of their financial power, the systems such as those of Venezuela and Iran and less and less constrained by the international rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1295"> The latest among the big countries, such as China, the same old habits and long tradition and their eyes to turn a blind eye to the violations of human rights, in order to guarantee of profitable contracts with authoritarian regimes and rich in oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1296"> Only the weight of political and economic, industrial countries which are the main consumers of oil can begin on a worldwide scale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1297"> It is important to start by the transport sector, which currently accounts for more than half of the oil consumption will increase in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1298"> As a result, the countries of the Union will have to agree to more register of running from the year 2025. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1299"> This decision is not directed against the individual, but against the waste of a rare use in preference to producing materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1300"> The political leaders should not or or such technology. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1301"> Rather, they should make the car industry to develop alternative technologies which use biofuels, and even natural gas, for a period of transition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1302"> The countries that have opened the way to the political will in the field, so that national, these national industries in first place in the technology of the technology. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1303"> The important strong reduction of CO2 emissions could ultimately lead to progress on the international political climate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1304"> The economic development is also at stake: if we treat our "," at risk, the poor and less developed countries, so that the new industrialized countries, could have more, this would bring down prices and the competition policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1305"> At the level of the situation, the benefits would be all too evident, notably the large oil exporting countries would be much less capable of blackmail the industrialized countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1306"> This turnaround force of negotiation of the international Community in the Middle East and Community in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, who wish seriously to promote the economic and political reforms of the Interior. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1307"> Great producer countries in the car and advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1308"> Angela Merkel, which is a PhD in reconstruction and has started his political career in the post of Minister of the environment - presiding in 1995 the first Conference of the United Nations framework Convention on climate change, would be more credible than any of the other Members of the European Union and the European Union to confront the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1309"> It is high time to make an act of political courage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1310"> The myth of the humanitarian aid and trade </SEG> 
<SEG id="1311"> The humanitarian aid and trade of words to the international fashion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1312"> A humanitarian aid (accompanied by a debt) and a better access to the markets of rich countries for products from poor countries: it now seems to have taken the top of the international agenda. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1313"> In fact, the debate today is no longer on the measures to be taken, but on the quantity of measures to be taken and how quickly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1314"> All in all of this: the clear lesson to be learnt from the past five decades of economic development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1315"> At the forefront of these lessons, one discovers that economic development is largely in the hands of poor Nations themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1316"> The countries which are managed in a recent past have achieved thanks to their own efforts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1317"> The humanitarian aid and the markets have played a minor role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1318"> Take the example of a developing country that has a free and preferential access to the market of its larger neighbour, which is also the most powerful economy in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1319"> Let us that this country is able to work of millions of its citizens to work on the other side of the border, receives a huge volume of foreign investment and is completely integrated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1320"> Moreover, the banking system of the country is supported by his and his willingness shown as lender of last resort. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1321"> Globalisation could come under better than those, is it not? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1322"> A second country now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1323"> This must be faced with a trade embargo on the world market, accepts or foreign aid or any form of support on the part of the Western world, is excluded from international organisations such as the WTO and can take with the IMF and the world Bank. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1324"> If these external channels were not, they can add an economy which it itself barriers against the international trade (in the form of trade, customs barriers to the importation and quantitative restrictions). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1325"> As has been able to guess the countries, those countries actually exist: it is a matter of Mexico and Vietnam. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1326"> The shares a border with 200 kilometres long border with the United States, which offers not only the privileged access to a market of goods and control of work, but also to a part of the resources (as the experience of the crisis in 1995 has demonstrated). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1327"> On the contrary, America has maintained its trade embargo against the, in 1994, has not restore its diplomatic relations and has granted the status of another more than several years later. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1328"> Vietnam is still not taken to the WTO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1329"> Let their economic performance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1330"> Since the signing of the in December 1992, the Mexican economy has experienced an average annual progression to just over 1%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1331"> Not only this figure is well below the rate of the champions of the economy in Asia, but it is also only a fraction of clean in the preceding the crisis of the debt of the (3.6% per year between 1960 and strike). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1332"> The production, however, has experienced an annual progress of 5.6% since the early stages of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1995, and has experienced a rapid growth in 1995 of 4.5% since. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1333"> Vietnam has been witness to a dramatic poverty while that Mexico has experienced in real wages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1334"> These two countries have the experience of a marked, international trade and foreign investments, but the overall picture is highly contrasting where the improvement in the improvement of levels of life, particularly among the poor populations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1335"> These examples show, it is that the other all the other elements in the determination of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1336"> All this that the American market had to give in Mexico has not been able to counteract the consequences of political mistakes on the internal market, particularly the inability to reverse the actual evaluation of the exchange rate or to extend the gains in productivity or in a sector of the rest of the economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1337"> What remains of the adoption by a country of a strategy of growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1338"> Without any of the benefits which, Mexico, Vietnam has pursued a strategy of her on the diversification of its economy and the improvement of the production capacity of local suppliers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1339"> The experience of the evidence that domestic policies are what is most important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1340"> South Korea has at the beginning of the 1960s, not when the subsidies were at their Summit, but when they began. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1341"> Taiwan has not benefited from subsidies or access to certain markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1342"> China and India, of the moment, thanks to their own efforts of economic reform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1343"> It is trying to put at the request of the request of export products of and Mauritius, the industry and the clothes), but it cannot go very far. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1344"> Of course, these two countries without access to foreign markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1345"> But, as in all cases of development, which are not the external channels which they benefit but their ability to exploit these advantages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1346"> It is enough to see how other countries have the advantage that obtain their natural resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1347"> The word 'diamond "does not give rise to the spirit of a picture of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1348"> Similarly, some areas of treatment of treatment throughout the world have experienced the level of development that they observe in Mauritius. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1349"> That does not, however, the rich countries of their obligation to help. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1350"> They can lead to the life hard to corrupt dictators, by sharing best financial information and in refusing to recognise the international contracts that they sign. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1351"> Similarly, the increase in the number of workers from the poor countries entitled to work in the rich countries and a broader range of policies oriented towards growth thanks to the rules of the WTO rules and conditions imposed by the United States to a greater impact on the development in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1352"> It is not proven that the expansion of access to markets and subsidies represent the best use to make political capital of the Northern hemisphere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1353"> The development should concentrate on the improvement of the environment policy in the poor countries, rather than on aid and trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1354"> Interdependence </SEG> 
<SEG id="1355"> If the great Argentinian was alive today, there is no doubt that it would wonder if the world is set to turn to the costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1356"> His theory was influential, advanced that if the poor countries relied too on exports of raw materials, they never level as necessary to support a rapid growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1357"> They are in place in a cycle of decline in the prices of raw materials and reduction of income. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1358"> The answer, the protectionism, has proved to be disastrous for the countries of Latin America and Africa which followed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1359"> But the fact is that over the years, seems to have been right about the subject of the price of raw materials on the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1360"> The permanent in the areas of agriculture and of the extraction of natural resources to lower the price of raw materials, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1361"> With a few exceptions, the countries which are focused on exports of raw materials have obtained results, while the countries of some resources have made rapid progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1362"> Today, however, with the Asian giants, India and China, that many of the world economy, the costs of the essence, however, wheat and practically all the others blow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1363"> Of course, there will always be cycles (the price of oil, for example, the undoubtedly again before his) but the trend in the long term of many in the long term to allow for some time yet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1364"> What many commercial and other today did not seem to recognize again, then that would have understood right away, it is that this reversal of situation, the huge implications for the balance of powers of influence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1365"> In fact, no other aspect of economic globalization together the leaders of the world over the decades to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1366"> There are many questions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1367"> The rich countries today are prepared to enter into a period, in which they will be of raw materials that developing countries are industrial products and technologies? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1368"> They are the inevitable flow of power and influence for the producers of raw materials to enrich? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1369"> How the two world, China and the United States, are going to manage the fact that important areas of exporting raw materials from Africa and the Middle East for Central Asia are covered poorly trained? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1370"> Certain outline the problem as one of the limitations of the natural reserves and claim that the raw materials at an alarming rate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1371"> At present, many are the supporters of the peak of "of the production of oil, which supports that we have reached the limits of our production capacity, that wells and that the situation is worse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1372"> However, however, as the birds and proclaimed that the resources in black gold were on the point in at least four times already. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1373"> Every time, technological progress to fly these threats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1374"> At the end of the 1800s, the extraction of oil extraction with with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1375"> Today, 3 000 m under the soil of the natural world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1376"> Such progress has also been made in the areas of agriculture and of extraction and agriculture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1377"> No, the world is not confronted with a shortage of raw materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1378"> In reality, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India) in the world economy produces a movement of the request to put more pressure on the increase in the price of raw materials that raw materials will without doubt able to counteract. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1379"> As a result, and this at least 50 to 75 years, and perhaps even until the human side on March over the centuries to come, the costs of many natural resources are going to rise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1380"> The new balance of powers and that result from going to destabilise the situation worldwide policy? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1381"> The first world war was started by the concern of the of the other colonial powers of too large a part of the world's oil and raw materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1382"> Similarly, during the second world war, the system for the stability of its supplies in oil and other natural resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1383"> Such tensions between between China to even the rarity in water is problematic and the West? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1384"> Fortunately, this does not for the moment, especially in view of the approach within the problems of their country shown by the Chinese leaders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1385"> The turn of regions such as Africa in the hope of finding trading partners industry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1386"> They do not share the politics of the Americans, who do not only want to do business with the exporters of raw materials, but also want to convert. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1387"> And then there is these leaders who speak again make the self-sufficient in terms of energy resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1388"> It is a joke: sufficient, perhaps, but never. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1389"> A large part of the Arab world, and it is understandable that the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the American strategy aimed at obtaining stable energy resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1390"> If they are right, one can only hope that the solution of a solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1391"> In the meantime, the price of raw materials will continue to increase, and the situation of oil, the largest of the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1392"> Perhaps the real American strategy does have the exporting countries so much money that these will become dependent on the happiness that they bring in America! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1393"> That is a fundamental that, would never expected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1394"> The choice of Iran </SEG> 
<SEG id="1395"> The choice of politicians to bear in the power of the Mayor of radical, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, risk of damaging the relations with the West and emphasise the isolation of the country at international level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1396"> However, in terms of national policy, the Islamic regime will without doubt better than if a more moderate candidate was taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1397"> It is clear that has a real basis of support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1398"> The fact that it is presented as a populist, that he has spoken to help the poor, condemned the government and has virtually as an opposition does not count: it is the choice of the system, and ended up by accepting an official aid, including against rivals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1399"> The regime has shown a great skill. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1400"> It has transformed the, a little more pragmatic, disagree with certain governmental political in character, in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate rebels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1401"> The government has the to consolidate its own power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1402"> Given that the former President, supported, supported the Reformist movement, even if it was somewhat reckless and that he has achieved nothing, and that is that only to what extent the leaders have returned to their advantage the political situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1403"> Is a representative of all the young people of the revolution of 25 years ago. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1404"> It is directly involved in the taking of hostages, in Iran, although they do not know to what extent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1405"> The most worrying is that it is close to the two main groups which represent the most extremist elements of Iran: the guardians of the Islamic revolution and the organisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1406"> The first is an army; the second; the second is an organization which intimidates opponents and whoever is in search of a more open society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1407"> However, this concern to see Iran in the hands of even more radical is qualified by two factors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1408"> First of all, without doubt, will concentrate on national systems, and try - that they can predict its chances of success - of improving the living conditions of the poorest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1409"> Secondly, the Group in power since the revolution will continue to lead the ideological and foreign policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1410"> The President has powers than it appears, and it is particularly eclipsed by the Supreme Ali Khamenei. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1411"> Though it is, the election of the challenge that really represents for Europe and the stability of the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1412"> First of all, it sends the message more extremist elements and extremists of this country - the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and a number of small groups which act against the Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries - that they have the Green light to launch their attacks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1413"> They will no doubt feel that Iran will support, although they do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1414"> In appearance, Iran has often shown relatively cautious, in part, the role of terror. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1415"> Officials, who have, for controlling and coordinating specific operations, will feel more free to act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1416"> In addition, advocates an intensive programme of obtaining nuclear weapons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1417"> The majority of politicians, in any case, those that the government to act at the big, support this programme, but a more discreet and prudent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1418"> Rafsanjani, for example, the establishment of better relations with the West before the advance on the nuclear front. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1419"> So, is the President of Iran, it is more likely to use weapons of a hazardous manner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1420"> That does not mean that it would use, but rather that it aims to blackmail power, making up the threats of levels of crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1421"> Since the Iranian leaders proclaim daily their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the United States (has walked on the image of an American flag), the risk of confrontation has increased. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1422"> Finally, is likely to be at the point of endangering the stability of Iraq, and will encourage the encourage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1423"> Iran sending many agents in Iraq and supports customers who try to turn this country into a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1424"> The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, which follow the same version of the politicians, such as the reaction of such political. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1425"> A more pro-active position with Iraq, and, even more to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1426"> In short, the result of the elections in Iran is dangerous, even if its potential, and this will depend on the degree of power that it will grant Khamenei. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1427"> In addition, have openly extremist - - according to the criteria of a regime already hard - will constitute a challenge not only for the United States, but also for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1428"> The European countries will continue to claim that the political campaigning and do not, and that it is possible to find solutions to the ambitions of the refugees? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1429"> With a real agreement, or at least the appearance of a cooperation would have been easier to maintain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1430"> But, with words, it will be a huge amount of reconciliation to that would be that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1431"> Some reformists and ", because the election of words, because they feel that his administration is more likely to prove the true face of the system and to all hope of compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1432"> But it can also represent the success of the regime to turn to its advantage dissatisfaction caused by a quarter of a century of radical Islamic reign. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1433"> What are the consequences, the victory of means for the West that everything is going to become even more difficult. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1434"> Let us, give </SEG> 
<SEG id="1435"> President Bush on the point of the American budget for the years to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1436"> When President Bush took up its duties, the anticipated and as long as they could imagine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1437"> Today, thanks to a mixture of cuts and a massive increase, the explosion of the on the stock market and a massive increase in military expenditure, the increase in the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1438"> The worst remains to come, because the Bush administration and the Conference to worsen the disorder. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1439"> The damage that they will weaken probably the instability of the international economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1440"> Usually, the American Republican Party defended balanced Budgets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1441"> It changed with the government, who, when the favourable tax reductions, even if it well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1442"> The President announced to the American people that it could enjoy at the time of the strengthening of the army and the continuation of their public spending. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1443"> The result, without surprise, was a series of important budget deficits and elimination of which took several years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1444"> The President George Bush, insofar as the President bill Clinton to increase taxes to set the agenda in the chaos of the Reagan era. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1445"> These increases taxes have probably contributed to the defeat of President Bush, by bill Clinton in 1992. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1446"> However, had decided bravely of completing the process to restore the balance is, in part to protect the funding in the long term reform of social security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1447"> When had left the Presidency in 2000, the budgetary situation was the better for decades. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1448"> Then came the President George Bush son, ready to play, with considerable, a considerable increase in defence expenditure and the continuing and even the development of programmes of expenditure Mexico. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1449"> The result was predictable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1450"> In January 2001, the budget for the years 2002 to 2002 to a budget surplus of billions of dollars. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1451"> These surpluses, had. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1452"> In the light of these new economic conditions, and in the shadow of the war against Iraq, one could expect that the Bush administration and the Congress Party in the defence of new tax reductions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1453"> But far from there, the main priority is to put in place more fiscal reductions which only the will to a large extent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1454"> At the same time, the government, the increase in military expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1455"> With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, they can be sure that no significant reduction of expenditure will not intervene in the programmes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1456"> It appears, therefore, that the massive budget deficits are intended to continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1457"> If the spending of simply remain consistent, at the level of a fraction of national income, the budget for the next ten years a total budget of EUR 1.5 billion dollars. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1458"> But this figure could be very optimistic, because it does not take into account the cost of a probable war against Iraq, or another set of tax reductions, or the risk of the increase in the rate of interest for the years to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1459"> Why the Republicans do so much concerned by this benefit? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1460"> Some were more concerned about tax reductions for easy than anything else. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1461"> Others believe that the deficits by force of the jobs of government spending, reducing the participation of the State, which is their wish the more expensive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1462"> The issue of this last analysis is that the majority of taxpayers are attached to social programmes and easily large cuts in spending. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1463"> The question remains as to why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it will probably problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1464"> One of the possible due to the fact that many voters do not come to see the budget problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1465"> A better response is due to the fact that the majority of Americans have in fact not vote for these policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1466"> The rate of participation of the election of 2002 was that of 40% of the electorate, and only around half of these 40% voted for the Republicans, is about 20% of people entitled to vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1467"> Of course, the budget should not necessarily be so bleak. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1468"> The war against Iraq will be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1469"> The fiscal reductions could be moderated or abandoned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1470"> But I predict of education for the years to come and a growing feeling of unease in the Interior of the United States and about the position of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1471"> The foreign investors could decide to reduce their funding from the budget deficit and the current government of America in terms of salary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1472"> The dollar could weaken, and the fear of inflation could become still more marked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1473"> All of this will lose confidence in the political decision-makers who will then be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1474"> The disadvantaged, the United States and abroad, could suffer most, since President Bush and the American people and to the whole world that there is no money available for dealing with the issue of poverty, health and education, the budget deficits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1475"> If the American means not open the eyes on these risks, the costs for could benefit from another gift of billions of dollars whereas the countries and the world bear the consequences for the years to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1476"> Keep the fiscal </SEG> 
<SEG id="1477"> George W. Bush has done well to annihilate the economic policy of the United States that all the other Presidents of the history, exceeding even his, Ronald Reagan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1478"> In just three years, it has destroyed a political agreement which had ten years of efforts and which might require another decade to be rebuilt. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1479"> This being so, the health of economic and social stability on the long term of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1480"> Given that the budget and on the long term that govern the EU a highly imprecise challenges are not, offer important lessons in other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1481"> The main problem posed by the fiscal policy is that the politicians can easily perceptions of levies and increasing public expenditure while collecting massive public debts and leaving their repayment in future Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1482"> This type of may last few years, but the budget deficits and public debt of our earlier than expected a change of policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1483"> A cynic can Nevertheless to buy its funds and perhaps to be Party to this when the crisis occurs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1484"> One might imagine that after decades of similar episodes of policy in the countries of the world, the whole world, to this type of type. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1485"> However, again in buying a popularity in distributing the while, at the same time, the military and the expenditure in the field of education and health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1486"> The budget deficit thus obtained is equivalent to more than 5% of GNP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1487"> Worse still, the financial perspective in the long term of America were already worrying before it begins to apply its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1488"> The American population is ageing, so that the costs of the pension systems and health care financed by public funds will increase dramatically. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1489"> Calculations show that show that the fiscal fiscal policies advocated by Bush are likely to do not reach the articles of the amount of dollars which represent the costs of pensions, health care and the care of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1490"> A certain time in the future, it will be necessary to reduce public expenditure, or both, to compensate for the actions of President Bush. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1491"> Then why the population supports its policies? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1492"> Because it includes these consequences on the long term, or that it cares little, even if these consequences will have an impact on the majority of Americans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1493"> The taxpayers the richest are of course happy because they have benefited from the major part of the tax cuts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1494"> Also surprising that it may seem, 5% of the Americans have benefited from around the Middle of tax cuts and these have clearly that if the other 95% (the Middle classes and the support of the majority of the majority of taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1495"> Meanwhile, which has a large number of voters and questions of the complaints that they should also be pleased to their fate, without saying to them that they will have to pay their taxes by more following reductions of the future policies of its management prevail in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1496"> If the Americans had a dumping policy, they understand that they have already this' mountain 'fiscal power over the last 20 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1497"> Ronald Reagan has also taken its functions in massive tax cuts and a considerable increase in military expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1498"> It is completed by a huge budget deficit in the 1980s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1499"> The tax cuts were made by extremely popular and allowed him to be re-elected in 1984. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1500"> It has been a decade (from the second term of office until the President George Bush, and bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1501"> Of course, this result has called for the approval of new taxes, which has cost its funds to George Bush, and has resulted in the 1990s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1502"> The history of great opportunity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1503"> Some parties in the Bush administration estimates that the current budget deficit reduction in the end a drastic reduction of social spending from the government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1504"> They hope to dismantle programmes such as social security and trust. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1505"> But the American population supports these social programmes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1506"> So the strategy which is Firstly to reduce taxes in order to reductions in social programmes is doomed to failure and the increase in rates of taxation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1507"> Other ideologists of the Bush administration that taxes play a crucial role for the United States out of recession. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1508"> This argument is also wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1509"> The economy of that would have been the tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1510"> In any case, it is a mistake in that in the long term, on the economic cycle in the short term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1511"> Other countries have two essential lessons to be drawn from this situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1512"> First, it is that of the United States will of the United States of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1513"> The Americans have supported the war in Iraq solely because they had not to subsidise by higher taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1514"> When the Americans will be forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less inclined to support costly military operations abroad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1515"> In fact, the United States will be deeply divided intensively in the population will be taken with the measures taken by President Bush. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1516"> The second lesson is that the countries must have their Budgets in terms of increasing costs caused by an ageing population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1517"> The budgetary conditions in the long term it is taken into account by the taxpayers or Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1518"> The governments must be brought in to submit budget evaluations on the long term at the same time their proposals of annual budget in order to reduce the tendency towards a political manipulation in the short term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1519"> The EU can play the role of a signal to other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1520"> The White House should give to the other countries in the Council that the advice to the public, to give: "do not try to do the same with you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1521"> The politicisation of the securities markets </SEG> 
<SEG id="1522"> Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets of developing countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1523"> By contrast, a primitive economic governs the securities markets in the advanced countries and at their priorities, in fact to predict the growth of trees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1524"> This description of the securities markets in the developing countries is not wrong, only partial, because the same applies to the description of the securities markets in the advanced countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1525"> In fact, the better than to the performance of the securities market of any country comes at the bottom to predict the degree to which the government wishes that investors of securities markets is involved in the current political environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1526"> Take the case of the United States, far more important in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1527"> The government and the quiet firms and returns on investment in the securities market forces us to reflect and of a capitalist economy base. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1528"> This explains in part why the United States attract the portfolios of the whole world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1529"> But the returns which make the markets do not so attractive to reflect a fragile political equilibrium. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1530"> In particular, the rate of taxation which affect the securities in the course of time with the change of political pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1531"> In the course of the second world war, for example, the political support to the has diminished and the government has greatly increased the tax on the profits of the higher incomes in general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1532"> When the second world war has enabled us to it by the great depression, President Roosevelt and to put in place a tax on the profits tax in order to ensure that the shareholders do not release a benefit too as a result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1533"> By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the securities market was at a low level, the Americans have elected Ronald Reagan, a man felt by many as too to the right to be President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1534"> It has requested, and has got the tax on the profits of the income. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1535"> The political interference in the securities market does not only concern on the tax on the profits of the income. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1536"> The taxes, indirect taxes, import duties and taxes on sales, which are all funds, directly or indirectly, by the companies, may have an impact with on the benefits of businesses and therefore on the securities market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1537"> This is not a chance if everywhere where transferable securities markets, governments to see to it that these these taxes in the profits of businesses after tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1538"> In fact, the policies of the securities markets do not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1539"> On the contrary, practically every activity of the activity of the benefits of businesses and, subsequently, the securities market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1540"> Following the crash of 1929, the American government, a large part of the activity of a to obtain a monopoly which allowed their value. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1541"> This policy has delayed the fall in the rate of unemployment, but not enough to tackle the political forces deployed to support the securities market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1542"> Similarly, one of the most important actions undertaken by the President who has been to destroy a large part of the trade unions, who obtain obtain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1543"> The victory of the strike of air traffic controllers in the air to the trade Union movement, and also for the securities market, and to the increase in 1982. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1544"> The us government has shown particularly to support the market since the culmination of the prices of actions in 2000, and in particular to reduce interest rates on several occasions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1545"> Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, and not in terms of support to the securities market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1546"> But it is very revealing of the extent of the American market values that one of the most important factors that influence on the economy with regard to the price of actions in decline. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1547"> In fact, the response is not itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1548"> The national accounts of products and not the United States show that the real rate of tax on the profits of businesses (the percentage of the funds in the government in the form of taxes) in the form of taxes in the course of the first in 2000 (the record of the securities market and the economy in general) and has fallen to the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was down. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1549"> A large part of this reflects the measures of fiscal measures by the Congress so that the perception, among the companies, that in the current economic and political environment, they can be shown to be more to avoid paying tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1550"> Moreover, after the crash of securities market, the maximum tax on the maximum tax on the securities has increased from 35% to 15%, providing a new investors in the long term and on the long after tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1551"> Once again, this reduction of tax was justified to stimulate the economy which can, of course, apply to support any measure intended to support the securities market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1552"> But it is the balance of political power, which determines the credibility of this type of intervention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1553"> One could argue that the same variables, including the hostility towards high taxes and a weak Union movement, have worked in the United States over the past 200 years and that they should continue to work in the future, generating high returns on the securities markets and more floods of foreign capital. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1554"> Those who think that the investments on the American market to follow the same trend of securities for decades could very well have reason. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1555"> But it is important to be clear on what they predicted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1556"> The forecasts above all not only on the economy, but also on the policy, or even on the cultural, political and economic performance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1557"> The real market </SEG> 
<SEG id="1558"> It is no more than the residence, that they buy is rooted in a strictly, as the taste of local economic conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1559"> The whole world marches on our television screens, but the property market, made up almost solely of local, takes account of local geographical borders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1560"> Soon, however, this could change. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1561"> A month from now, the Chicago (, in collaboration with my corporation, so that, as with poor, options on contracts to the property prices in ten cities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1562"> The contracts will be based on the price of contracts will be established, in terms of research established that my colleague Karl and myself, it has almost twenty years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1563"> For a long time, we, in favour of a market and in the long term, but, until now, no use these indications for creating such a market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1564"> The markets, on the future of the whole world to invest indirectly in the American market, by means of these markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1565"> A purchaser to Paris, Rio de Janeiro or markets will have the possibility of investing in occupied by their owners to new York, los Angeles and tired, amongst others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1566"> One of the fundamental principles of the financial - or the new risks - implies that the interest for these new contracts will greatly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1567"> The companies and the inhabitants of new York, for example, are overexposed the risks of allowing. however, selling their term, they should do to reduce these risks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1568"> Investors in Tokyo assume a part of risks in buying accommodation in new York, if the price is right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1569"> The new continue to live in their homes, in having investment risks everywhere in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1570"> The experience of a genuine market in the family has not been for since 1991, when the London and options (called) the launching of such a market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1571"> This has never led to large volumes of transactions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1572"> The stock has launched a concept which did not convince anyone. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1573"> The markets on the estate, just as some of the markets, in line, have never many reported either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1574"> I will this time? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1575"> Of course, the launching of a new market is still uncertain. people interested in an idea if it already many others; if nobody is already, it did not attract further. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1576"> The same goes for the markets, and if it is not to be concerned, it will not happen to generate profits which in turn of others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1577"> However, as this is the case for all the ideas, we never know very well why they entice. too, we cannot predict the start of this new market, but we know that, sometimes, the success is to date. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1578"> The initial indicators suggest that the growing interest in transactions for, especially in view of the talks on the speech on the importance of the diversification of risks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1579"> After the Summit, one of its competitors, the Chicago board options exchange, has declared its project of creating options on urgent contracts in the large areas of Europe, based on the price of means issued by the national association (national association of real estate agents). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1580"> However, in addition to the strong public interest for the real and cover risks, another thorny issue must be regulated so that the markets operate well: the costs must be openly revealed and investors have to understand the meaning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1581"> I believe that there are great opportunities for these markets of the fall in prices in certain towns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1582"> It will be a matter of 'if', as their traders and today, the price on the market is lower than the cost of a property. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1583"> Probably, the appear from the first day of the first, but it should happen at the end of a few months. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1584"> We might need if some of these markets carry out their functions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1585"> Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge known in the course of these last years (this is a worldwide phenomenon test). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1586"> The international investors do not seem very inclined to invest in those cities, without the prospect of a fall in prices based on the drop in the inhabitants of markets have taught at their expense. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1587"> However, if the will is important enough, even the investors who think that the market is in decline will still be able to expect a good return of property prices in the long term, because they already benefit from a lesser price on the market in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1588"> However, the new will need to go to some adjustments to cover their own investments or, if they want to sell contracts on the training of course a fall in prices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1589"> They will have to get used to the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and that they can protect themselves that the minute margin which shows this anticipation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1590"> In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking will no doubt if they notice, the future of the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1591"> Up to now, the evolution of prices from the market has essentially been the result of various opinions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1592"> When the markets will create an international consensus on the subject of prices in all the major cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks that they meet in stabilizing their economies on the one hand, and on the other hand, our own levels of life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1593"> But what does move? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1594"> Since 10 may about, the majority of the world markets were accused of strong cumulative declines, notably in the two weeks around 23 may, with an average of course which persist to fall. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1595"> The concerns on the stock exchange markets for the economy of the world? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1596"> Let us more marked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1597"> Among the main countries, the most impressive is that of India, where the lessons of of between 10 and 22 may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1598"> The collapse of the other side of the globe has taken almost. there, the ups and downs have had that some of those with those of India: in Argentina, the courts have fallen%, in Brazil% and Brazil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1599"> The European markets have also suffered losses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1600"> In Sweden, the lessons of 15.2% between 9 may and the 22 may; practically over the same period, they have fallen% in Germany, in France and in the United Kingdom and Italy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1601"> In Asia, prices have fallen by 5% in Korea,% in Hong Kong and of 8% in Japan almost over the same period. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1602"> Many commentators trying to combine these events to the situation in the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1603"> However, the Americans have only a fall of 5.2% between 9 and on 24 may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1604"> China does not appear not to be behind this decline, since the courts have increased over during this period. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1605"> The explanations of the standard of the monetary policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1606"> In the wake of the great fear of the fear of the Central banks of the whole world, the world of the interest on markets and prices on the stock exchange. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1607"> But today, if they believe this point of view, the interest rate of increase, which allows new decline in the markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1608"> Without doubt, there is an important element of truth in this argument. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1609"> The us federal reserve has in fact increased economic interests, and its President,, then, has indicated that other increase could take place in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1610"> On 17 may, a worsening of data that has been mentioned, that leaves one monetary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1611"> Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1612"> But in doing so, they often the role of the Central banks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1613"> In fact, the increase in the register in a whole series of new rate - the 16th. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1614"> No other large European Central Bank has increased its rate after the start of the decline of the decline of June, the date on which several are implemented (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1615"> Another factor: the price of oil, which has increased from 24% between 22 March and on 2 may, beating all records. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1616"> This was undoubtedly constitute a major event capable of influencing the whole world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1617"> The increase in the price of oil play the role of guilty in practically all the economic recessions since the second world war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1618"> And yet, the price of oil is not at the moment when the courts do not correspond at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1619"> Could that these increases have caused the decline of markets that a shift of several weeks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1620"> But the stock markets are not very logical, and a response shifted from the oil price shock might be possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1621"> As for all the way in any financial market, an increase of draws attention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1622"> When oil prices rise quickly, the people looking at the news that some talk and discuss them of these increases by themselves, creating a greater aid to these new. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1623"> The crisis in the Middle East is related to the price of oil, and it has been the constituted the month of may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1624"> Signs of birds and the strong language used by various political personalities could be amplified in the spirit of the increase in oil prices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1625"> On 8 may, the Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in reaction to the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President that "the Iranian President should remember that Iran could also be wiped off the map. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1626"> Similarly, in the vicinity of the beginning of the end of the month, the country with the largest number of Muslims in the world, and the newspapers have reported on 13 may that he had received a reported on the part on behalf of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1627"> This may have been interpreted as proof that the strategy of the verge of words in the nuclear field it brings on policies, feeding the perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to further increases in the price of oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1628"> These articles of newspapers can be even more remote from the stock markets that monetary policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1629"> But the public reaction that they cause, so that the increase in oil prices, could go for a good measure in the change to the psychology of the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1630"> The attitudes change with time, and as the events of and can throw these changes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1631"> Therefore, although these events are difficult to quantify the analysts should pay greater attention to the words of words when they try to understand the direction that the stock markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1632"> The who perhaps do not like to focus on the problem of the public and on the way in which it interacts with the price fluctuations, with the and the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1633"> It would in fact that economic events are less and less predictable (who) than to imagine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1634"> However, from a point of view it would be logical to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1635"> That is really in the head of investors? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1636"> Nature, is a figure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1637"> Ahmadinejad boards in an adventure, then. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1638"> And, perhaps the most important, the destabilising influence, not then. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1639"> Whatever the outcome, falls worldwide stock indicate a psychology of the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1640"> Difficult to believe that they were linked only to opinions concerning the possible monetary policies, and not to questions more extensive and more questions, notably concerning the energy and political tension, which are the foundations of the priorities of the world economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1641"> Why are we paying more for fair trade? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1642"> Marks & Spencer, the chain and clothes and clothing throughout the United Kingdom, has just announced that it was announced that she was going to complete understanding 38 different products in the ‘ fair trade ’ label, the symbol of the 'production and consumption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1643"> The markets already only tea and coffee carrying this tea and coffee "coffee shops". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1644"> It also encourages the and other goods of starting from the fair trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1645"> This announcement has taken place during the equitable in the course of these two weeks of promotion of products, of meetings have been held with the producers in developing countries in order to explain the British how this form of commerce has helped their communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1646"> The movement towards a more experiencing a significant advance in the United States the consumers themselves more and more and more towards food produced foods, such as the, such as in freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1647"> In the United Kingdom, a study showed that more than 50% of those surveyed questioned fair and equitable that products bearing this that the working conditions of producers from you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1648"> There is currently no study in the United States, but the data presently and the discussions I have had with my own students student amounted to the Americans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1649"> The traders wishing to secure the certification fair trade producers must pay a price covering the costs of a sustainable production and a salary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1650"> For example, the course for a book of coffee is $, regardless of the fall in the level of the market price. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1651"> If the costs of this figure, the number will increase in order to remain more in order to book. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1652"> For small producers, they have to organize itself in cooperatives or other types of groups. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1653"> The plantations and the claim of fair trade label if they offer a decent wage to their workers, so they conform to the standards of health, environmental and safety, or any other form of associations of workers, so they form the workers who work away from them, and if they do not use or forced labour, nor the work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1654"> However, all the world do not agree with the fair trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1655"> Brink, director of the centre of studies on the political studies Institute, commercial organism, considers that the campaign for the fair trade is a is paved with good intentions'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1656"> It is important in that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices does not lie in the implementation of the multinationals, but in the considerable increase in the production of coffee in Brazil and the production of new techniques and culture, by working less and as a result, at least cost. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1657"> In the perspective, however, if we want to help the coffee farmers, we must encourage them to leave them to turn up here, quite rightly, on the trade restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on the subsidies which constitute obstacles to be removed - or for products of high added value, such as that of which can be paid more expensive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1658"> What is in the perspective, however, it is that the campaign for the to do exactly what he advocates, that is to say to encourage farmers to produce coffee more expensive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1659"> The economists, does not include the companies which use the attraction of luxury to promote their products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1660"> If people are prepared to pay to spend to 48, because it is the coffee of James bond, economists estimate, in this case, that the market is distorted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1661"> Why, then, to be so critical towards the consumers who wish to pay $12 to 48 which they know that it has been cultivated pesticide, under the trees favourable to the survival of birds, by producers who can now feed and educate their children decently? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1662"> That might retort that if one wants to help the people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a coffee, identical to $10 and pay $2 to a charity which distributes the food and the poor children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1663"> It is indeed a possible strategy. however, fair trade has advantages. </SEG>

<SEG id="1665"> If their coffee sells well, they are proud of having made a product sought in the whole world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1666"> From the point of view of farmers, get a premium in selling a product fair trade is preferable to the achievement of a charitable assistance they receive in any case, that they work or not, and what is the quality of their production. </SEG>

<SEG id="1668"> In addition, the interest of better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1669"> It is not only a funding granted by the governments, depending on the request of the market and policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1670"> Fortunately, in Europe, this request is growing rapidly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1671"> Let us hope that it will quickly such levels everywhere in the developed countries, where the consumer can decide to their conclusion on the way to spend their money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1672"> The calves, pigs and American </SEG> 
<SEG id="1673"> Among the headlines on the back of the democratic majority in Congress after the elections in November, the result of an important result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1674"> Although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it has also enabled us to think again to the sympathy of the ordinary American citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1675"> In spite of the citizens, whether they have met a sufficient number of signatures, submit a draft law on at the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1676"> This year, one of a law to ban that was brought to the meat, are in the way that the, down or of their Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1677"> Those who do not know the intensive methods surprised the necessity of such legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1678"> The traditional farming, such as it is everywhere in the world fifty years ago, and in some countries, even today allows animals move and themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1679"> But today, close to 90 percent of - the mothers of pigs raised and slaughtered for meat, and the ham - passing the bulk of their life in that measure around 60 tempted by 2, 200 metres. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1680"> They can neither be able, or to extend their legs, once again, nor of more than one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1681"> They are also sometimes to limit their movements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1682"> In the same way, the calves are their lives in individual where they can return, down or ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1683"> For the most part, these methods have objective to save the costs of manpower and facilitate the management of animals and use less of workers, and less qualified. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1684"> They also prevent the animal waste of energy in or in fighting between them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1685"> Some years ago, in the wake of protests from the animal welfare organisations, the Commission of the European Union has called for a report to the standing veterinary Committee of the EU on the intensive methods. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1686"> The conclusions of the report show that the suffering of animals not being able to move and trouble have nothing to make the entire days. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1687"> Of course, the simple good sense to arrive at the same conclusions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1688"> Following the report, the EU has set the date from which the confinement of animals will be prohibited. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1689"> For the calves, on 1 January 2007. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1690"> The individual sow stalls, already banned in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned from 2013 in the whole of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1691"> Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, in battery in cages without enough room to extend their wings, are also applied progressively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1692"> In the United States, nothing of the sort is planned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1693"> Previously, when my friends, asked me why the United States such a delay in the well-being of animals in relation to Europe, I know that reply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1694"> If they insisted, I had to admit that a possible explanation was that the Americans were concerned less animals that Europeans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1695"> Then, in 2002, the associations of defence of the animals to submit to the vote on a proposal to ban a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1696"> In general, the proposal was accepted by 55% of the votes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1697"> Last month in spite of generously funded by the food industry, the subject of the prohibition of calves and pigs has also been approved, by 62% of the votes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1698"> Neither the Florida, or the States are particularly progressive - both have voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1699"> The results of these two popular votes so strongly suggest that if all the Americans had to decide on the maintenance and in confinement, a broad majority oppose. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1700"> In the final analysis, it seems that the Americans are just as much as the Europeans of the living conditions of animals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1701"> In order to explain the difference between the well-being of animals in Europe and in the United States, it is without doubt the political systems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1702"> In Europe, the concerns of questions concerning the living conditions of animals have found an ECHO with Members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, with the effect of the adoption of national legislation and rules of the EU to improve their fate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1703"> In the United States, however, these concerns have had no visible effect on the Members of Congress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1704"> There is no federal legislation on the welfare of animals and to say no legislation at European level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1705"> Àb in my opinion, the tens of millions of dollars of the food industry pocketed by the representatives of trying to be re-elected is for something. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1706"> The movement of animals, despite a strong popular support, does not, in the political arena, and donations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1707"> In the American, money, the money that the opinion of the voters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1708"> The left is weak and the bulk of the funds needed to their funds - in this case, every two years for the Members of the House of representatives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1709"> In Europe, where the discipline is respected and where the parties, and not to the candidates, not the election campaigns, the money plays an important role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1710"> In the United States, a country that is proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are not the only losers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1711"> What of work on the new Turkish made? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1712"> The murder of the aviation by a crowd prompted by the Members of the interim administration of Afghanistan) shows that). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1713"> The first on the Turkish army to stress these divisions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1714"> The Minister of defence of the administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has already indicated the senior officials of this new territory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1715"> The Minister, Mohammed, is a region of the in the North, that is, as soon as the leader of the Northern Alliance forces which have that after the Kabul. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1716"> As a Group, its allocation constitutes a direct challenge to the objective of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1717"> Afghanistan is a nation, the most important being the Group, which represent the two fifths of the total population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1718"> And the one fifth of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1719"> On the high ranking of general by are Tajiks, are being. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1720"> If, on the fifteen million, some countries are recruited as soldiers, they serve under a framework of completely composed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1721"> The language of different, however tajik as the Spanish and English, and millions of attaining a military service have at best only some notions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1722"> The profile of the new military authority is also restricted its ethnic composition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1723"> Thirty-five on the senior officials are in a small area of understanding the province of province of airport) and the close valley and the perception of the Northern Alliance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1724"> In other words, the leaders of potential in the provinces of Afghanistan have been excluded from the new countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1725"> A Group if restricted could perhaps overcome the impression that its Members are a clique closed if they represented a broad cross-section of the dozen of political parties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1726"> But this is not the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1727"> Eighteen senior officials come of a single Party, the, the Islamic faction that has long been directed by the, and a long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1728"> It was this that in a short time in the Middle of the 1990s, creating the 1990, which have led to welcome the advent of the Taliban. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1729"> The Communists equal practically the number of Members in the hierarchy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1730"> Sixteen the long line on this Party tricks at the end of the 1970s have led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which has two and a half million lives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1731"> The most consider the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1732"> It is true that the Afghans, as everywhere else, have joined the Communist Party for various reasons and that they were in any case in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1733"> But in the case of the generals, six were professional workers from the Communist Party and have continued to use the Party after the invasion of the red army. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1734"> These six men, three Communists who have served in both officers in the army, which actively during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which has lasted a decade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1735"> Imagine how the French have reacted if a quarter of the government of the second world war were after during this occupied in their country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1736"> In Afghanistan, the new travel quickly by it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1737"> The nationalist (that is to say practically all the men) will discover the reasons of Members from the Members of the general, if it is not already done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1738"> Even this overwhelming proof of bias and prejudice in the formation of the new army could be if the could be and a commitment to the values of professionalism and indeed national armed forces in their task. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1739"> Unfortunately, only ten of the promoted by received a training of professional. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1740"> An eleventh has served as a pilot. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1741"> By contrast, on the remaining (the remaining four remaining remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come from the Communist Party or, in any case, which have been in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1742"> That means all these statistics in terms of everyday reality? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1743"> They mean that when the forces of peace in Afghanistan, as well as the officials, as well as the American military defence, they meet the Afghan Lord of the war and a point, which remains in contact with the old friends of the army, which are still in Moscow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1744"> This means that the leader of the armed forces so that the leader of the operations and the leader of the service and of the leader of men which puts remain unclear and which many men. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1745"> This team of opportunity to unify Afghanistan torn by war? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1746"> The presence in Kabul a so suspicious chances to instil confidence in the three-quarters of the Afghan people, who are excluded from the top military order? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1747"> This list or constitute the harvest of a "all" for the winner of the government which is obliged (at some point in the future) to make spark off a bloody reaction by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1748"> The UN and the European and American political leaders must reflect on these matters before agreeing to an implacable power by a small minority unpopular. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1749"> The irrational </SEG> 
<SEG id="1750"> Hurrah for new Nobel Prize winners economy: the College and Smith Smith. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1751"> As many Nobel Prize, these not undertaken not only the work undertaken by Mr Smith, but, but also the schools, they have helped to develop. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1752"> Mr, psychologist, has demonstrated that the resolution will not include any less classical manner that the traditional thinking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1753"> Its work, not only that the resolution sometimes act differently predictions theoretical standard economic, but also that they are regularly, consistently, and in a way which can be understood and interpreted across different hypotheses which play in competition with those used by the traditional. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1754"> For the majority of players in the market, and in fact the ordinary, it does not make much difference. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1755"> The wall brokers who make traffic with actions that they know to be bad exploit the irrational that Mr, but have demonstrated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1756"> A large part of the fad that swelling, was based on the exploitation of the psychology of investors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1757"> In fact, this is not new to the economists either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1758"> John Maynard Keynes formerly the stock exchange as being based on the possibility of individuals to discover the foundations of markets, but rather as in a beauty contest in which the winner is the one that has been the best of those judges will say. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1759"> The price of this year the celebrated the criticism of the free market too, just as one of the last year (I have received with two other colleagues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1760"> The winners of the last year of the emphasis on the fact that the various participants in the market have different information (and (), and that this information has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1761"> More particularly, the winners of the last year that the markets are not efficient in general; that governments have a greater role to play. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1762"> The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to efficiency as guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1763"> That, too, is not something new for those who work on a daily basis with the markets (and a fortune in using this imbalance of the information and the excess). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1764"> For more than 20 years, the passion for these so-called model "of the world if the principle that all the actors have the same information (even () and (a), that the markets are rational way, that there has been no unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions or minimal imposed by governments), and that there has been no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1765"> Such models are are, particularly in the course of the United States, the United States, which demonstrate the triumph of ideology on science. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1766"> Unfortunately, these are the decision-makers of many countries and they try to put in place programmes based on these ideas, that one of the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1767"> Let me be very clear here: the models of irregularities have contributed to the economic theory; the theory that the rigour imposed on the economic thought has enabled us to highlight the weakness of many hypotheses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1768"> Any good scientific thought knows to its limits, but the general showed little modesty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1769"> Smith is one of the leaders of the development of the economy of the experimental, the idea that we can test of many proposals in a laboratory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1770"> One of the reasons that are that the economy is a subject so complex, which also explains the many discrepancies between economists, comes from the fact that that can lead. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1771"> The nature of the experiments, but in the majority of circumstances, many things can change so quickly that it is often difficult to sort out the causes of the consequences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1772"> In principle, in a laboratory, they can lead, controlled, and this made of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1773"> The criticisms of the economy of the experimental about the fact that the subjects the experimental contexts modes of thought determined outside the experience, and so the experiences and are also not and clear that in the natural sciences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1774"> However, the economic some knowledge of a number of important issues, such as the design auction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1775"> Above all, the market players, the question of the work of Mr, verified repeated in the context of laboratories. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1776"> One of the results of the funny released by the experimental economy raises altruism and selfishness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1777"> It would seem (at least in question) that the experimental subjects are also not make that economists believe, except a Group: that of democracy itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1778"> It is a discipline which attracts individuals who are, by nature, or or because of the need to individuals so as to enable them to make? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1779"> The answer, indeed, is surely a bit of both. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1780"> There is no doubt that this question and the research and indirectly to resolve this issue of the relative importance of these two hypotheses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1781"> The Nobel Prize shows how important it is to study the resolution and the economies such as they are and not as we want to see. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1782"> It is only by including human that we can hope to conceive of policies which will also make better functioning of our economies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1783"> Bush and his policy of bad faith </SEG> 
<SEG id="1784"> One of the most, this year, in the course of the world economic forum in Davos of the oil industry have explained that the experts of the CAP - much faster than all the announced - is not only a problem, but also a chance in the fact that new huge quantities of oil are now available. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1785"> In the same way, these experts have recognized that the refusal to sign the law of the sea, the international Convention which determines the access to sources of offshore oil and other resources maritime, represent a risk of conflict. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1786"> However, they have also stressed the advantages: the industry does not need new supply, does not need to obtain the Congress to secure the right to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1787"> The President George W. Bush has a strange ability to understand the important messages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1788"> For years, it is increasingly evident that energy policy does not turn round. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1789"> Certain Members of his Party refer to a former energy bill, drawn up by the oil industry, as being very beneficial for all the lobbyists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1790"> In carrying at the virtues of the market economy, the sole purpose of granting subsidies to the oil industry, in spite of the increasing the country must face. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1791"> However, the market does not work properly when it is a question of a intervention should take a completely opposed to the one that the Bush administration has proposed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1792"> The fact that the Americans do not pay the price of the pollution - and especially of their production of greenhouse gases - resulting from their devaluation of the cost of the energy and time, an excessive consumption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1793"> The government must encourage the economies of energy on the setting of prices, essentially by means of energy taxes, is an effective method of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1794"> But, instead of promoting the energy savings, persists in a policy which is first of all resources, "of its own resources, the return to the future even more dependent on external resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1795"> Some matters that a strong push up the price of oil and thus create a for many countries in the Middle East, which are not the best friends of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1796"> Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has Finally taken the measure of the growing energy clearly it had become difficult for him not to become aware of the consequences of the increase in the price of oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1797"> But, once again, the gestures of his government not to aggravate the problems in the immediate future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1798"> Bush still refuses to act in favour of energy savings and to Finally very little money to support its ongoing request of salvation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1799"> That, then, of the recent statement of position on its commitment to reduce, in 25 years, the oil dependency on the Middle East of 50%? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1800"> For the investors, the message is clear: do not invest more in the new for the Middle East, which are the resources of the least expensive in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1801"> However, if there is no new investment in the supply of the Middle East, the unbridled growth of energy consumption in the United States, China and elsewhere implies that the request of the offer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1802"> And to crown it all, the threat of sanctions against Iran could cause disruption of the provision of one of the largest producers of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1803"> With a worldwide level of production of oil chance to its maximum and having almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this to once more, and still more profits for the oil industry, the only winner in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1804"> Though it is, nobody should accuse have recognized that there was a problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1805"> But, as always, its proposals do nothing more than a little trick of its administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1806"> Besides its refusal to accept the heating of the planet, to encourage energy savings or allocating sufficient funds for research, improving the competitive position of reducing dependence on the face of oil from the Middle East does not mean great thing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1807"> With only 20% of the Middle East, the Middle East, to be reached, in other regions of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1808"> The Bush administration must realise that the use of the world market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1809"> Even if that was completely independent of oil from the Middle East, the reduction in the production of energy in this area would have devastating effects on the world market prices and more on the American economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1810"> As it is too often the case with the Bush administration, there are no clear explanation of the official policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1811"> Bush is playing with the and the Americans? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1812"> Or is yet another example of incompetence and confusion? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1813"> In terms of what we saw in the last five years, the right answer indeed contains more than a few bad faith and pure stupidity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1814"> The road map of China </SEG> 
<SEG id="1815"> China is on the point of adopting its five-year plan, raising to extend this which is without doubt the most remarkable economic transformation of history, while improving the welfare of almost a quarter of the world's population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1816"> Never before the world had known such a lasting growth; never before has there been such a reduction of poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1817"> The explanation of the long-term success of the long term of pragmatism and vision of the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1818"> Whereas a large part of the rest of the developing world, following the agreement of Washington, is initiated in a search for consensus of Washington, China has once again established once more and more equitable levels of human life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1819"> China is aware that it is coming in a phase of economic growth of huge demands on the environment which will last. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1820"> Unless change of standards of living. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1821"> It is for this reason that the new five-year plan places the emphasis on the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1822"> Many regions amongst the most have grown so fast that they wonder if other parts of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1823"> While this phenomenon has reduced poverty, inequality have increased, with growing disparities between urban and rural areas, and between regions of the coasts and the Interior. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1824"> The report of this year of this report explains why the inequality, and not only the poverty, should raise concerns; now the plan of China is the 11th at issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1825"> The government evokes for several years a more harmonious society, and the more ambitious plan represents for achieving this goal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1826"> China also acknowledges that what separates the least developed countries of the most developed countries is not only a difference of resources but also of knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1827"> It has therefore drawn audacious plans to reduce these disparities and to create a basis for innovation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1828"> The role of China in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1829"> Its growth will be based more on the request on exports, which entails an increase in consumption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1830"> In fact, the China suffers from a rare problem: an excessive savings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1831"> The people save partly because of weaknesses in the programmes of social protection now: to strengthen the social security (Commission), the public health and education will reduce social inequality at the same time, increase the well-being of the citizens and promote the consumption tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1832"> If it worked (and up to now, has almost always surpassed its own high expectations) these adjustments might impose huge pressure on a global economic system already by huge costs and the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1833"> If China puts to save less - and if, as announced its representatives, it follows a policy more diversified investment of its reserves, which is going to finance the trade deficit of over 2 billion dollars a day of the United States? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1834"> This is a subject to another day, but this is perhaps not so far. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1835"> With a vision of the future, the future, in the implementation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1836"> China is a great country, which would not have been able to achieve as well without a vast decentralisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1837"> But the decentralisation lays down its own problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1838"> The greenhouse effect, for example, are global problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1839"> While the American proclaims that she does not have the resources to do anything to this subject, the most senior officials Chinese have acted in a more responsible manner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1840"> In the space of one month after the adoption of the new environmental taxes on cars, the essence and the products they have been imposed: by using the mechanisms of the market to solve its environmental problems and those of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1841"> But the pressure on the representatives of local governments so that they create the economic growth and jobs will be enormous. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1842"> They will be very tempting to say that America is not capable of producing in order to protect our planet, how can? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1843"> To bring this vision in this, the Chinese government will need strong policies, notably following increase taxes on the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1844"> While China itself into a market economy, it could develop certain problems which are the scourge of developed countries: the specific interests of the personal interests under a mask of the ideology of the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1845"> Some people trickle-down: for the poor, the final end by European growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1846"> And the policies and the laws of competition and the level of business: Let its wonders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1847"> The arguments of growth for strong social and environmental policies: for example, to increase taxes on to our car industry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1848"> Such policies not only fail to provide growth, they would threaten the whole of the vision of the future of China. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1849"> There is only one way of avoiding this: the economic policies in order to false and give us the means to implement the creative solutions to the many challenges that China must meet today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1850"> George W. Bush has shown as it is dangerous to restrict the decision to a narrow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1851"> The majority of people out of China does not go to any point of its leaders, on the other hand, are involved in extensive deliberations and even with the problem that they struggled to solve the enormous problem to which they are confronted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1852"> The market economies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1853"> They simply cannot be allowed in automatic pilot, especially if one wants to ensure that their profits are widely shared. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1854"> But to manage a market economy is not easy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1855"> It is an act of reality which must always react to economic changes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1856"> The five-year plan of China produces a movement in this direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1857"> The world open the eyes, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be converted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1858"> The lessons on the democracy </SEG> 
<SEG id="1859"> Due to the war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of the debates of the nature of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1860"> That is famous for having rejected the reactionary, considering that democracy was our destiny, we warning, however, on the dangers that it conceals for freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1861"> Must we share his concern? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1862"> The democracy of all as a political system, but above all as a team system which shapes the customs and habits of the company, allocating him so a sociological and psychological dimension. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1863"> That thought that the democratic course of our thoughts, our wishes and our passions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1864"> There has been the figures of the century, and at no century homosexual, "is a form of the human being. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1865"> For that, the systematic effects of democracy can bring the citizens to abandon their ability of reasoning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1866"> They can only judge of events and values by themselves, when in fact they repeat of reducing the opinions of the majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1867"> What are called 'social' on the opinion is without doubt a stronger in the democratic systems - a point of view that left to the level of demagogy and manipulation by the media in the modern world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1868"> Thought that in the long term, nothing can actually to this trend. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1869"> Neither the Community, or of small groups within society, or the opposition, or civil rights can prevent the decline of the critical thought that democracy appears. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1870"> The school as well as possible to cover the influence of the mind. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1871"> In the same way, thought that the research of the States in the way of a religious faith could raise, but the one and the other are incompatible with the democratic ideal from the moment they are imposed by the authorities in the framework of public life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1872"> In this sense, the London school of Hannah Arendt above all the disappearance of the right in modern societies are the heirs of the thought of that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1873"> They may also note that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet called one of these recent its democracy against itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1874"> For these, democratic way of life, to eliminate any original thought and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, giving the place to a mediocrity that leaves the citizens have faced the enemies of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1875"> If the history is full of criminal systems and manipulated, the greatest risk of democratic countries is to see their citizens in the indifference and is limited to a thought in the short term, in search of their immediate interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1876"> The past - despite the as that to which the historic events - is concealed by the, in respect of the present and of the last innovation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1877"> Even the ruling class, meant well educated, is a victim of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1878"> The main problem lies in the lack of democratic awareness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1879"> So that the proclaimed, the shortcomings of the democracy do relinquished the only way - realistic but unacceptable - which is open to us? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1880"> I do not think so. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1881"> There are means to combat what one might call the 'democratic' that they see spreading. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1882"> The first of these resources is to develop a system of an education system which forms, notably through the teaching of matters was largely (present) that are the literature, history and the philosophy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1883"> If one wants to make informed and capable of thinking by themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools have run after the ongoing and begin to develop our analysis of students. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1884"> Because of their tendency to cultivate the superficial and entertainment, the mass media constitute the main obstacle to such an education. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1885"> Today, many people spend more time in the course of their life in front of the television in the classroom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1886"> The passivity that the mass media is the exact opposite of the active involvement of the citizens, to democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1887"> But it is difficult to imagine that the mass media (in part) the quality of their own will become the tools of an education that the critical spirit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1888"> This focus on the mass media does not a contempt for the popular culture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1889"> It is not just a question of Mozart was extremely - in its time and pieces of Shakespeare attracted the poor insofar as the rich - but the refusal of the culture of calling into question and cause. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1890"> It results from an indifference and a passivity of the general public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1891"> For a long time, a culture of media globalized spreads more and more, the slightest criticism or the feelings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1892"> Due to its lack of interest in these matters, it is a culture which threatens democratic freedoms because it creates in no way a sense of duty in respect of the company, history or of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1893"> It is too late to defend itself against a culture which at this point the minds? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1894"> The elite of his time because of their willingness to respect fully the dangers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1895"> The short-sightedness of our leaders going to promote the implementation of its concerned? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1896"> A Europe for all </SEG> 
<SEG id="1897"> The Members of the European Union of the future of the European Union, but the European Union the European Union with a hope and a certain hope. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1898"> The basic objective of our foreign policy is the Commissioner, because that Ukraine has discovered that national autonomy is not an end in itself but a single issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1899"> In fact, the European unity is indivisible: when a nation is no nation, no country is free. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1900"> We are Europeans, all linked by a link with which we cannot avoid, linked in a single measure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1901"> All the aspects of culture that we share, without speaking of women suffering that we share, we confirm. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1902"> All this affects a European directly affects us all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1903"> We shall never allow us to live with the narrow, a Europe of the haves and a Europe of living, of Members elected officials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1904"> Whoever lives on the European continent today may, in fact, to be considered as a his. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1905"> The large Europa of today, just as the prosperity, depends on it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1906"> Some people will say, of course, that the Ukraine is not part of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1907"> They come to Kiev and meet its inhabitants, young and old, the workers, the wives of farmers, the lawyers and the doctors and teachers who are raised and are left standing in the cold and snow weeks to defend their freedom last winter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1908"> To those who are not those around the general de Gaulle within the French resistance? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1909"> Do they not body with those who fight for the defence of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those that Budapest in 1956 and put an end to the military in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1910"> They are not of the same mind as one that and masses of the velvet revolution in Prague in 1989? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1911"> It is the soul of Europe, and no doubt could destroy it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1912"> To all those who consider that the Ukraine is too to the train to become a Member of the Union, I say this: that they come to them as they come and visit that country and later in the office to teach children the use of computer of their office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1913"> They come to assist in the course of every town and city where our youth for Europe in preparing for the French, German and English. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1914"> Those who have doubts about the European vocation of the Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a simple issue of motorways and: it is freedom, freedom, prosperity and solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1915"> I believe that our future is also promising that the past of Europe is proud, and that our fate is not that of a land frontier in an area but that of an influential of peace and of the unity of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1916"> Self-determination is synonymous with reach national independence of our present on the return on the world stage, with a new status. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1917"> The new Nations can build with their having the same kind of fruitful relationship that France has established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1918"> This is the type of relationship that my government wishes to establish with Russia, it is so that we can help to extend the area of peace in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1919"> It is premature, of course, go beyond the indication of the utmost importance that we attach to the possibility of entering the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1920"> We know that our role in this building will establish a night. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1921"> We know that the work of the European unification are not restricted to the documents and the documents but take root in the innovative action designed to improve the living standards of security to all Europeans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1922"> Building a worthy Ukraine to adhere to the European Union will not be easy, either, nor without effort. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1923"> But just as the European Union itself, and that it will be done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1924"> We know that the challenge is big but it really is worth it, and Europe must understand that this is our objective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1925"> The restoration of the Ukraine and in part by an innovative action in order to put an end to a century which during which the fascism and Communism, ideologies born at the heart of Europe, have the power to take power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1926"> Throughout the Union has quoted a few months ago, parents and children confronted armed troops, dogs and even death. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1927"> It was only a few years yet, a young journalist Georgi Gongadze, trying to inform the public about the corruption of our former bullied and corruption in the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1928"> Our Orange revolution, the last winter, has proved that the Ukraine and its people could take. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1929"> Thus, despite the difficulties, I keep a confidence in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1930"> I refuse to accept the final as final answer the horrors of the history of the Ukraine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1931"> I refuse to accept the idea that the Ukraine is so tragically compelled to live in the Middle of the night without stars of the point of being able to see the point of the day of peace and of a genuine European unity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1932"> When the citizens of the European Union to reflect the place of the Ukraine in Europe, it is necessary to consider the contacts and knowledge to look beyond the face that we show. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1933"> See beyond the devastated areas that we have imposed Communism, beyond the poverty and social divisions through which our former leaders today have sought to extend their hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1934"> It will need the face of our President, up the devastated by the poison that it has managed during the election campaign last year, and to recall the words of that great French and to remember that, for that 'the most beautiful faces are those who were injured. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1935"> The war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1936"> The gap between the East and in the Middle East is far more profound than antagonism between Israel and the Arab? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1937"> One might think in seeing the reaction of certain Arab governments in the decisions of the attack Israel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1938"> While the Israeli bombs falling on on, Saudi Arabia, perhaps State most of all, has condemned the acts of the conflict which has initiated against Israel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1939"> Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a State which regards itself as the leader of the had supported supported. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1940"> In addition, the breakdown of the Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not a unique case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1941"> Egypt and Jordan and the conflict and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, for their order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1942"> What is really behind this astonishing situation? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1943"> We are in the process of a basic turn in the relations between the Arabic nationalism and?? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1944"> The government of Saudi Arabia feel afraid and concern in the face of concern that it involved in the Arab unit and the Palestinian cause? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1945"> The denunciations of conflict by Arabs suggest that the Muslim sectarian, already evident in the daily in Iraq, is important and intensifies throughout the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1946"> The will of the President George W. Bush to destroy the cold in the Arab world was compelled to raise the forces of the modernisation of the traditional against the Islamic and Arab societies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1947"> It seems to the place to released from the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1948"> The opening of this black box has been able to give birth to a to one general violence, which can be described without doubt that of "civil war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1949"> The gap exists since the dawn of the history of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic Shiite Iran, as well as the domination of by the Arab countries, in general, has left this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1950"> These tensions have stood at the wave of "and" created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake the identity of sectarian and has been further back in the background to appeared that "a general clause". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1951"> All that has changed a terrorist, a Group which is widely ideology and the personnel, has made its attacks against America in September 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1952"> A branch of the amount of the militant Islam was set in motion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1953"> When the United States have launched at the time against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and against the regime, this new trend radical more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1954"> The dream of the region, which have now gained in insurance, sees Israel and the West as a threat, the other consisting of including the earth that extends from Lebanon in Iran in passing by Syria and Iraq and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1955"> The leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the Muslim faith and of the sacred sites,. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1956"> For the Sunni, Shia do not dominate the rich regions in Iran, Iraq and the regions is of Saudi Arabia, they also, by the actions of the conflict, to usurp the role of "to usurp the role of all the elements, the Palestinian cause. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1957"> It is because the Saudi Arabian and questions of a strict form of Islam and calls into question the honesty of its population of that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1958"> The irony of the thing, it is that of America,, Saudi Arabia, has made the decision remains the responsibility of Saddam Hussein and putting the parties in power in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1959"> The Bush administration seems to recognise what she has done; in the world in the United States, the United States are trying to consolidate their protection - Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia - in the West of the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1960"> Israel, formerly implacable enemy of the issue and, seems today in this defensive structure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1961"> But such a defensive position is unstable, by the alone. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1962"> Today, the citizens were not take off and other networks and other networks following the events in Gaza and in South Lebanon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1963"> They see the blood flow of Arab (not follow), and only the reply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1964"> For them, the conflict has become a model of heroic resistance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1965"> This situation is pushing the Saudi to enlarge schism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1966"> According to the official through by the UK, the Saudi peace has asked to issue of condemning Hizbollah as deviating and concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1967"> Such sentences can only exacerbate divisions within the Saudi Arabia and in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1968"> Before the worsening of these differences, the systems, to believe that they have need of their own Central to fight in their corner? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1969"> If they manage to this conclusion, they will not need to look far, because the because of this type have already followed a -. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1970"> Why Europe cannot ignore the Georgia </SEG> 
<SEG id="1971"> The time when Europe could support on America to make war, to restore peace and democracy in its own course is past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1972"> With the enlargement of the European Union, and as the recent crisis has demonstrated the Russian gas, this Court now includes not only Ukraine but also in Georgia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1973"> In fact, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is being put to the test and Europe cannot afford to ignore. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1974"> Georgia was the first country to operate its "good" and to do so, with dignity and maturity, the choice of its people in favour of democracy and of European values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1975"> The flags of the European Union which float on all the Georgian public buildings since then, although the Council natural, as old as the history of this country which, for the ancient Greeks, an integral part of the time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1976"> Prométhée and in Azerbaijan, Noah's Ark, are all signs that the Europe of our myths starts there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1977"> By its history, its civilisation, its traditions, but also the more recent, when the and the republics of the former USSR, by his critical attitude, as indeed, is without doubt still today the place of this space where the democratic transplant can take better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1978"> It is therefore all the more worrying to see the democratisation of the country under threat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1979"> All seemed to have sufficiently well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1980"> Thanks to the launching of a policy of reforms, of privatisation, the fight against corruption, the research of searches and therefore of the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return to Europe in the Georgian game. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1981"> The State of mind of totalitarian has since again at these leaders who, proclaiming the representatives of the majority, are to still more powers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1982"> It is a clique that such a does not and ashes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1983"> Those and their methods of power that the ‘ rose revolution ’ in November 2003 now once and for all to the heart of power, with the help of their networks, with the external borders, considerable financial burden, their borders to the and the manipulation of the political and national. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1984"> It is a power that does not respect the essence of democracy which is not in the ballot boxes and the balance of powers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1985"> Every day, the government legislature, the very great majority of the presidential; Parliament wants to monitor the exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their daily functioning! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1986"> Finally, and this is the most serious, the power of the judiciary does not yet to be freed from the executive and represents or even for the citizen or the investor the guarantees and the protector, without which it is not right, or of economic freedom </SEG> 
<SEG id="1987"> It is a society that to be democratic in his head, is not yet in its legs. to engage in to get involved in allowing the stage so to those who care for too long. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1988"> Because this democracy is in danger of, but because it is still there, still there in the population, in the organisations of civil society, in a press which seeks but which does not lose its ability criticism... </SEG> 
<SEG id="1989"> It is time for Europe to save the democracy in order not to destroy all these hopes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1990"> The United States have already made that they were able, since independence, and they are on the side of the Georgian. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1991"> The stability was surely not identified in the projects under the impression, former Minister of foreign Affairs that the advice from his post as President of Georgia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1992"> But the Americans have invested in the survival and of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1993"> The criticism of the way, seems to me more: the Orange revolution has not been created by the Americans, does too used to the intervention in order to be able to think differently, but the democratic which has allowed has certainly been, encouraged and supported by the State of the foundation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1994"> The CAP which must be taken today so that Georgia must - this time, is a complex stage which demand a support of a different nature, that the Europeans are more capable of providing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1995"> The models which must be offered to the balance of powers, the institutions of the State of law, the functioning of the judiciary, or of democracy must take as a starting point the Anglo-Saxon model, American variant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1996"> If Europe today rejected this task, it its duty towards this country, small, small, flexible, long historical tradition, where democracy has much better opportunities to do that in Ukraine, which is all to the very surprised that in his mind, Let alone of Central Asia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1997"> Do not help Georgia, that is, that democracy and therefore take a long time to not only in Tbilisi, but even more in Kiev, to say nothing of Moscow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1998"> It is, above all, take a very serious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1999"> In that, with the ups and downs, infinite,, to resign themselves to the idea of the democratic, not without having to give up his imperial dreams and their instruments, could suddenly to review its perception. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2000"> This resignation, this approval of a normality in its relations with its neighbours, which was at its inception, can be taken by a sudden outbreak of the irrationality of the power of this too fine 'derjava "which do not withstand the attraction of the weakness of the feeling of space, to the temptation to be removed not equal to, but the strongest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2001"> This is what explains the recent gas crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2002"> All sign of decline of democracy, every, will be taken by Moscow as a discourage is in any case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2003"> It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that it spared in a return to the past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2004"> Europe has this responsibility in relation to itself, to its future energy independence and it also has the responsibility to show that there are also European values of freedom of freedom, democracy, justice between peoples. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2005"> For that Europe must equip itself with the instruments of its policy: a great and democracy, a partner which, again, a police, an army of judges and magistrates who live correct that we want. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2006"> Europe has my conviction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2007"> If Europe does not suit it that it is interested in the fate of its neighbours, of their democracy and to the future of its values and their values, which it? </SEG>
