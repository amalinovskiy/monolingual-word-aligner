<seg id=1> Our Charter of fundamental rights is the first in this millennium. </seg>
<seg id=2> We must succeed in ensuring that the Union of the fifteen in such a way that we the countries that are knocking at our door, under the proper conditions can start. </seg>
<seg id=3> In Article 87, the area of services of general interest for social, cultural and charitable interests to be included, so that this important institutions too long term can be protected. </seg>
<seg id=4> Some are of the opinion that we can create a single market in Europe, without on fundamental values and principles to be united. </seg>
<seg id=5> I in turn would like to the clear and substantial speech by President Prodi welcome. </seg>
<seg id=6> As you know, we in Amsterdam deliberately chosen to these two clear functions to be separated. The high representative is - in contrast to the Commission - not completely independent, but its task is the coordination of foreign and security policies, which are the responsibility of the Member States, and here we have the intergovernmental method certainly a larger place to give. </seg>
<seg id=7> He has expressed the wish that the Presidency in the future Nice show how. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is in fact a broader and better result wish, but I am frankly believe that we have made a good start. </seg>
<seg id=9> I therefore hope that the European Council in Nice this project agree and adopt, it specifically as a project, not as a fait accompli, to launch of course now the necessary reforms have been adopted. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, I have also specifically said that we in today' s reality extremely important objectives can be achieved with the Community method, such as, for example, now more effective action in the Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=11> Only if we Russia to the West and to commit the European Union, we will also be able to exercise influence on his policy and with Russia in contact and keep on talking. </seg>
<seg id=12> Motion for a resolution (B5-0767/00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union </seg>
<seg id=13> It is this genocide currently continuing to try and also, media freedom and the rule of law in Russia, which are hardly exist, not to eliminate. </seg>
<seg id=14> On the pretext of the expectations of this Rentners, the Giuseppe Italia is, in Cremona lives and like to the Po would sail with the ship, to be fair, I voted for the Piecyk report of the development and the development of the sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals. </seg>
<seg id=15> By the vote of this House will be the aim of the directive, which by all the speakers and the Commission has recognised and supported unattainable made. </seg>
<seg id=16> Mr President, I have, as I said during the debate, that is to say, before the vote, have made it clear to vote for the Skinner report, because I venture capital as very important to look at. </seg>
<seg id=17> My colleague Mrs Bordes Armonia yesterday it absolutely clear that only a minority to point out, Community funds and pensions insurance contributions to cover of entrepreneurs risks to use. </seg>
<seg id=18> Consequently, the Charter serves tend to the present, even retrograde practices to reaffirm the nation states to be a real step forward. </seg>
<seg id=19> Mr President, at last, is a Charter of fundamental rights of the citizen on the table, in which a whole Article, Article 25, dedicated to the elderly people. </seg>
<seg id=20> But if he would legally binding and incorporated into the Treaty would, as demanded by the European Parliament, he would inevitably in time to a unification of the national law of each of the European countries. It would mean that the Court a disproportionate power would that the centralisation in order to strengthen the European institutions and the independent of discretion of each nation would be restricted. </seg>
<seg id=21> Â· a very full of the Charter with detailed regulations should be taken and that the subordinate right reserved. </seg>
<seg id=22> I am going to vote in favour of a different Charter by I to the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz and in Nice on 7 December 2000 involved. </seg>
<seg id=23> Progress of the 12 candidate countries towards accession </seg>
<seg id=24> I believe that a number of Member States it still has not understood that there is this context and that the slow progress of the Intergovernmental Conference are in great difficulties can bring the enlargement in the period required to impose. </seg>
<seg id=25> All this, and I have spoken so far, we will, in the long term, only be achieved if in the candidate countries and in the European Union policy and the elites - and, in this context, limited I admit you are right, Commissioner, at long last, to work actively to ensure that the enlargement of the European Union for themselves of use. </seg>
<seg id=26> This is the general principle. </seg>
<seg id=27> Let me now to come second objective of the Presidency in these six months to make progress on the enlargement process wants. </seg>
<seg id=28> I therefore propose that you to work in this direction with the idea that we in relation to 2003 must examine the candidates are willing to us on this date to join. </seg>
<seg id=29> I would like to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his comprehensive report and clear. </seg>
<seg id=30> It is not in any way in the negotiations with the ' if ', it is only the ' how ' and ' when '. </seg>
<seg id=31> But you have done so because the prospect of membership of the European Union you the hope of the solidarity of the European peoples and because you as permanent political and economic to. </seg>
<seg id=32> A number of countries are at the second economic criterion of competitiveness in the internal market as well advanced that they quickly the accession approach. </seg>
<seg id=33> We therefore seek the possible engst coordination with the programmes of the national governments, the European Parliament and other institutions. </seg>
<seg id=34> Every year - and this will soon, on 8 November, once again be the case - will in each of the candidate countries with very great interest the Commission' s opinion on the progress you expect. </seg>
<seg id=35> Rightly we have for the principle of differentiation decided, which states that any accession candidate country according to its progress and services will be evaluated. </seg>
<seg id=36> This debate is a further opportunity for my group, to say that the accession of the countries of central and eastern Europe, but also Cyprus and Malta, the best secure future for all of us in Europe in the East and in the West. </seg>
<seg id=37> This is a matter of the utmost importance, but in the public little attention. </seg>
<seg id=38> Many of my made that after the fall of the Berlin wall the period up to the enlargement is always remained unchanged: five years. </seg>
<seg id=39> The next natural opportunity in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament in 2009, but we want to try to ensure that as many countries as possible already 2004 can join. </seg>
<seg id=40> In addition, there are six substantive aspects on which we because of the method applied have reservations. </seg>
<seg id=41> In reality, it is the elected model of the European agreement itself, in other words the simultaneous integration of all sectors, regardless of the traditions and special features of the parties involved, which leads this impasse. </seg>
<seg id=42> ' this in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s, almost articulated in general sense to give substance to, is for us all to date a commitment. </seg>
<seg id=43> But in order to clear things to call a spade a spade: there can be no accession to the cheap prices. </seg>
<seg id=44> It is a great and, at the same time, fine idea that we the enlargements not opposed to make the public, and that the best way, the enlargements, in accordance with the public, to carry out in its participation in the elections is, because the elections are an expression of democracy and a form of participation of the citizens in the political system. </seg>
<seg id=45> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to the conditions for a scenario say that this several parties called for. </seg>
<seg id=46> I would be very surprised if they do not exert pressure would. </seg>
<seg id=47> But I had already pointed out that all the countries of the accession relatively quickly approach. </seg>
<seg id=48> In other words, the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products has already agreed, without the Poland have the concern that this is why the Polish agriculture collapse. </seg>
<seg id=49> It has also been burdens, but on the whole have peace and trade the citizens of the Union countries closer together. Monetary union, has strengthened this development further. </seg>
<seg id=50> The results of the negotiations should be crucial. </seg>
<seg id=51> The only amendment that has been tabled is already contained in my report, but I am pleased that the group of the Greens the importance of equal treatment of citizens underlines. </seg>
<seg id=52> This does not only a law in the public service, but also that it is the young administrators opportunities and adequate remuneration. </seg>
<seg id=53> This applies both to Latvia and for the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=54> Is planned of the litas the links with the euro in the second half of the year 2001. </seg>
<seg id=55> (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, is the greatest and most important, but, as we know, at the same time, the hardest of the countries who are preparing to enter the European Union; it is such a whole host of problems in that it even rumours of a potential of Poland exclusion from the first group, in other words, the group of the first candidate countries. </seg>
<seg id=56> As have Poland and the eastern, former communist countries too many promises which we do not have kept. </seg>
<seg id=57> There is a point which, again and again, if it is a question of the Czech Republic, emerge. That is the problem of the Roma. </seg>
<seg id=58> Slovakia was not in the second group made, and logically it would at the same time, with the Czech Republic join. </seg>
<seg id=59> Finally, at the same time, let me make one comment on the internal policy possible. </seg>
<seg id=60> Thirdly, as regards agriculture, whose productivity still in the European Union is, as it will be necessary, the agricultural market fully for the privatization of land, modernisation of farms and the distribution network and to increase the need for capital returns to open. </seg>
<seg id=61> Bulgaria is very much to join the European Union and to NATO. </seg>
<seg id=62> The acute poverty is since 1990 one of the most serious problems Romania, but is under the current government, that the economic situation in fact for the better is. </seg>
<seg id=63> These issues will hopefully to priorities of the in 14 days constituent new Parliament and the Slovenian government. </seg>
<seg id=64> It is, however, to emphasise that a final fair and lasting solution to both the relevant resolutions of the un security Council, that is nothing more than the current international law, and the European Union underlying principles must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id=65> Malta has, moreover, on stable, functioning democratic institutions. </seg>
<seg id=66> Mr President, Commissioner, values, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs, we too should like to our part in contributing to this debate. </seg>
<seg id=67> They must also be implemented. The European law is not just a law in the books, but must also in the candidate countries in a law Action. </seg>
<seg id=68> This change is tough demands of the people in the candidate countries, but also safeguards at the same time, their future and the future of their children. </seg>
<seg id=69> Special attention - and here I agree with the previous speakers - is on the border regions place. </seg>
<seg id=70> The Commission must, in this context, not just be left. </seg>
<seg id=71> The applicant countries desire for a rapid economic growth, even if this is at the expense of a already laid down our nature conservation policy is. </seg>
<seg id=72> There was an exchange of bad habits, including in the field of health. </seg>
<seg id=73> Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and United European continent. </seg>
<seg id=74> The European Parliament and its Committee on regional policy, including in the area of transport and the trans-European networks is responsible, are aware of the need for the various sectoral policies in favour of a global planning to coordinate. </seg>
<seg id=75> Previously, however, an indication that the transport infrastructure of key importance to the success of enlargement will be. </seg>
<seg id=76> Mr President, I would like to echo those who, in the forthcoming enlargement of the main task of the Eu see. </seg>
<seg id=77> In the former planned economies of central and eastern Europe will in the traditional social values significant pressure. </seg>
<seg id=78> The evp would like to the responsibility for the accession pace not diminish the candidate countries, because we can no accession date record. </seg>
<seg id=79> The second point is the inclusion of data. </seg>
<seg id=80> There is another reason. </seg>
<seg id=81> Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and the positive prospects for the individual countries and for the Eu as a whole are - that Denmark has shown - greatly from that the European social and democratic deficits policy be reduced. </seg>
<seg id=82> Populism is the name on a worthy of the end, with the technocrats available will of the people, when he expresses a way that you does not. </seg>
<seg id=83> Ladies and gentlemen, you have Essens- recovery break and, it goes further at 9 p.m.. </seg>
<seg id=84> It is, albeit in the long term, a common currency for the entire continent. </seg>
<seg id=85> ' on these issues are internal conflicts in the individual countries sparked off. </seg>
<seg id=86> We call on you to fight for a different Europe, a Europe of all the peoples, the exempt from these inhuman Stigmata, in which all peoples to choose their own destiny themselves and relations of peace, freedom, brotherhood and cooperation to establish mutual can use. </seg>
<seg id=87> I would like to the work of these organisations this publicly acknowledge and this includes, above all, the challenge romanian appeal, in Birmingham has its headquarters, and organisations in Ireland, the supported by many people, including the Irish under attitude artists Daniel O ' donnell, which is a donation of EUR 1 million pounds and to this sum in Ireland and other parts of the world has gained. </seg>
<seg id=88> The summit in Nice must primarily clarify whether and how the Eu turn can put in the situation, even fully and in good time to become capable of enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=89> The Poland questions: will you, if we have joined us paid, or we are second class countries? </seg>
<seg id=90> I am sure, however, that in good faith and with the help of the European Union can be found a solution that the two communities a harmonious coexistence and live in prosperity, as for centuries has been the case. </seg>
<seg id=91> But we have also considering the question of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, their linguistic integration, in these countries is also important. </seg>
<seg id=92> The conditions for membership is actually meeting the fundamental Copenhagen criteria. </seg>
<seg id=93> We have a lot about one of the benefits of enlargement, but that is an area in which we of Lithuania can learn. </seg>
<seg id=94> Ask you, we will all be so! </seg>
<seg id=95> Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs thank and congratulate you, but I would like to concentrate on Slovakia focus, in particular, to the policy of minorities. </seg>
<seg id=96> I urge you to in Nice to set a date, by when it with the most advanced candidate countries - without behalf of indication - intend to the negotiations to end. </seg>
<seg id=97> The European Union must Bulgaria still on his way to the entry into the Union help and, of course, mean that the planning of this aid decentralised still takes place. </seg>
<seg id=98> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups in society, the government and Parliament plays an important and -as we say - positive role. </seg>
<seg id=99> But we are at the beginning of the division of Europe to overcome and no new to create. </seg>
<seg id=100> All of this is the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne contain, and I thank her on behalf of our group warmly for this report. </seg>
<seg id=101> This understand that should Cyprus, in my opinion, the issue itself, which has the ability of Europe, politically to take shape, to decide. </seg>
<seg id=102> I myself live near the Baltic, which for us all a matter of common concern. </seg>
<seg id=103> The political vision remains. </seg>
<seg id=104> So we are particularly pleased by the desire Klaus HÃ¤nsch noted for the pse-fraktion has said that the Commission a genuine assessment of the impact of enlargement and also the economic consequences will be, if it is not to enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=105> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, of Mr Wuermeling that it without transitional periods in the interests of both parties will not happen, and just as Member for a border region, so as Mrs Schierhuber a farm near the border Tschechischen has, I think it is a matter of concern that the emergence of the common economies without major problems can be tackled and a positive outcome on both sides leads. </seg>
<seg id=106> Three points I would as a social Democrat stress. </seg>
<seg id=107> The issues of the first pillar containing ewr granted the economy in the applicant countries access to the internal market, the youth and science to legal exchange programmes, obliges the Eu but not yet, its system of agricultural aid to extend these countries. Therefore would of the ewr-abkommen positive impetus, particularly for the economy in the applicant countries, because they have to do growth, for their society for accession to prepare, as well as for the economy in the Eu if is estimated that the cost of enlargement on the economic growth even represent two-thirds in ewr-modell perhaps even more. </seg>
<seg id=108> Secondly, adopt it by the Big Bang Â­ idea, many candidate countries at the same time, this would run counter to the principle that each country according to its progress to be included. </seg>
<seg id=109> Thirdly: we must do everything possible to ensure that by 2003 the European Union in terms of the excellent speech by the President Prodi on the enlargement process to prepare. </seg>
<seg id=110> I want to in the context of the relationship between Parliament and Council raise with the fact that it has been considerable delays in the reply to written questions. </seg>
<seg id=111> It is worrying that this is happening in a country which wishes to accede to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=112> I request a referral back to committee, in the preparations for the necessary steps to be. </seg>
<seg id=113> Mr President, today we are a total of three reports on this subject, including two of me to discuss and perhaps vote on it. </seg>
<seg id=114> This would at all stages of the food chain beneficial effects. </seg>
<seg id=115> Safe food mean in the whole chain costs. </seg>
<seg id=116> We must, therefore, Mrs Paulsen and agree with the Commission and the Verschneidungsverbot to the animal feed is safe and the European consumers are to be protected. </seg>
<seg id=117> The 1999 directive was well thought through, and you can even now there has been a success, because costs could be reduced. </seg>
<seg id=118> But then simply allow a mixture, is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id=119> Very briefly, we need to amendment no 37 on the dioxin problem press. </seg>
<seg id=120> On this point we agree. </seg>
<seg id=121> The result will be that we, as the European consumers continue to meat, milk and buy their by-products in the world markets from does not established by the Union emerging and feed corresponding limit values to be established, that is to say in a system, in which raw materials to be obtained on world markets, where everyone substance or any preparation freely can be mixed before the products in the territory of the European Union to be introduced. </seg>
<seg id=122> Before the second reading, the Commission should look at the planned procedures for risk assessment information. </seg>
<seg id=123> On the other hand, it would be severe, if, for example, amendments Nos 39 and 40 will be adopted, because it is the Member States will not be able to be, in newly discovered quickly dangers to intervene. </seg>
<seg id=124> Consumer protection has already starts with feedingstuffs, in the food resources content substances, the declaration and, finally, the official controls. </seg>
<seg id=125> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen on the undesirable substances in animal food is an important subject, as all the important issues a highly controversial. </seg>
<seg id=126> The debate on the excellent report by Mrs Paulsen, we have before us today was in some respects great feeling, and following the present debate, I think we must assume that the feed industry do apply strict conditions, the quality of mixtures, however, to be changed subsequently. </seg>
<seg id=127> Each of these three proposals will both individually and in the common cooperation contribute to the elimination of the main shortcomings by the dioxin crisis has revealed. </seg>
<seg id=128> With amendment no 33 is the re-export of food resources lots of the requirements of this directive is not enough, in the export three country be prevented. </seg>
<seg id=129> The Commission cannot accept amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which propose the possibility of dilution kontaminierter feed resources outcome products under certain conditions to bring back. </seg>
<seg id=130> This should be given our commitment enough that we in the context of the new proposal on the establishment of a food authority create a system for the rapid exchange of information, that the whole of the food and feed chain will cover. </seg>
<seg id=131> Commissioner Byrne, in this directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs concealed basically our old problem, namely the question of open declaration. </seg>
<seg id=132> And for me this is already the profits of the morning. </seg>
<seg id=133> Because if we do that, if we did it here quickly implement would and quickly go through the codecision procedure, which is certainly a great asset, and I am sure that we to the Council very strong and united. </seg>
<seg id=134> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in future, there can of course happen at least, but it is not impossible that contaminated in feed ingredients reach. </seg>
<seg id=135> The bse-skandal was the worst, most wellknown example. </seg>
<seg id=136> As our rapporteur has already said, it would be best if we a label to have open declaration, in which the list of ingredients. </seg>
<seg id=137> I think that the professional qualifications and the judgment of the members of the Committee on agriculture and rural development in the field of agriculture, and also in the field of animal nutrition is no question, in the sense of a practical and workable solution of the farmers and consumers will be applied and understood. </seg>
<seg id=138> As far as the positive part. </seg>
<seg id=139> I think it is a legitimate right to information, which we must take account of. </seg>
<seg id=140> On behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on fisheries and on my own behalf, I would ask you, Madam President, the relatives of the victims and the local authorities Brittany as MarÃ­n, Galicia, where most of the victims come to the attention of Parliament to send. </seg>
<seg id=141> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=142> would like to anybody object to the presentation of this oral amendment express? </seg>
<seg id=143> So we have the situation of the rapporteur states. </seg>
<seg id=144> Most of the technical proposals deserve our firm support, such as, for example, in the field of food safety, decommissioning of nuclear power stations of the first generation, protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the essential in the code of conduct for companies operating East from the West and much more. These are huge tasks and therefore absolute priority. </seg>
<seg id=145> At the same time, will continue to face considerable difficulties, particularly the budget. </seg>
<seg id=146> Enlargement to 13 countries not only change the geopolitical context of the European Union, but it is changing the structure, because on the one hand, the population will increase (+ 28 %), but also the number of ' disadvantaged regions '. </seg>
<seg id=147> It is to be noted that in the candidate countries a competitive agriculture and food because of their high economic and social importance for the successful transformations- and restructuring process will be crucial. </seg>
<seg id=148> In this context, I would like to express the wish that the outermost regions, which six of the seven still to the ten poorest count the Eu, structural funds are not just because of the bip-kriteriums, but also because of geographical, demographic and, above all, social indicators receive. </seg>
<seg id=149> As we this Europe in the interests of the French reject, we can its enlargement to include the countries and peoples of the East, the only just freed from communist dictatorship and still do not know in what technocratic and totalitarian you trap with this step, not in all conscience vote for. </seg>
<seg id=150> We would have been in the country reports and for a maximum of a short but concise resolution to leave them. </seg>
<seg id=151> It is currently practised system of aid, subsidies and quotas must by free trade and adapting to the market to be replaced. </seg>
<seg id=152> The importance and significance of the problems the enlargement will bring, does not with the hypocrisy with which discussed in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=153> On enlargement to speak means for me not to certain countries belonging to Europe to confirm or not. </seg>
<seg id=154> Our neighbouring country has, over the past ten years, hard to meet the accession criteria trying. </seg>
<seg id=155> Latvia has its place in this House, not only because it its progress overall the right to this ' confidence advance " give to a successful conclusion of these negotiations is essential, but first and foremost because we in Europe at home. </seg>
<seg id=156> I believe that Poland is the state of all the candidate countries best our support and deserves our commitment, because without the extremely important initiatives Poland would not Communism to case has been put, and we would not be here today, in order to deal with this issue. </seg>
<seg id=157> For the Polish people, which are still largely consists of Eurosceptics, this is perhaps not in the same way. </seg>
<seg id=158> I appeal to Prague, this message, this demand, this request for dialogue to take up to respond to this, and together with this House, to ensure that this legacy a nationalist era can be overcome. </seg>
<seg id=159> (EN) I welcome the report by Mr Wiersma, on Slovakia' s application for membership of the European Union and can the greater part of its conclusions, support. </seg>
<seg id=160> With great pleasure that I should like to take this opportunity to the elderly people and pensioners of the Republic of Bulgaria greet particular. </seg>
<seg id=161> If Romania continues to move forward and the European Union' s institutional structures and policies adapted to cope with enlargement, I see no reason why Romania is not included in the Union should be. </seg>
<seg id=162> The report' s position is clear to hard, whatever a solution to the problem could be the settlers, which, as well as the country return to both sides is extremely difficult. </seg>
<seg id=163> Unfortunately, some of the statements in the report of the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy on the application by the Republic of Cyprus for membership of the European Union which are not very helpful. </seg>
<seg id=164> In view of the lack of good will of the Turkish Cypriot community and Turkey, this will not be an easy task. </seg>
<seg id=165> Stenzel report (A5-0243/2000) </seg>
<seg id=166> Unfortunately, I was the victim of a, albeit slight, food poisoning the I fatal even targets in the European Parliament had. </seg>
<seg id=167> For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the proposed by the European Commission Verschneidungsverbot voted in favour. </seg>
<seg id=168> We must call on asem-lÃ¤nder in this resolution to put pressure on the military regime in Burma to where democracy is restored. </seg>
<seg id=169> We are not consistent in our approach and in the implementation of our measures. </seg>
<seg id=170> Now is not the time for small-mindedness and Verzagtheit. </seg>
<seg id=171> A number of important points in the regulation are firstly, adjustment of the burden of proof. </seg>
<seg id=172> Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the Eu. </seg>
<seg id=173> ' the are the reasons why we legislation to combat discrimination need. </seg>
<seg id=174> Also as a result of this, we now have a number of amendments subject legal, by the a Gleiches level of protection against discrimination on grounds of race, on the one hand, and for reasons of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, on the other hand, to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=175> He had to for balance, prudence and a good be trying right technology, and his report is, in my opinion, these qualities reflect. </seg>
<seg id=176> These are also members of the opinion that the discrimination is not often that special legislation should be. </seg>
<seg id=177> The funding for the programme is not enough, in order to replace the work in the fifth framework programme done and hopefully will continue in other framework programmes. It is our task to ensure that on the programme borders, cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=178> On the need to combat discrimination, there is general agreement on the as to what extent and by what means, however, opinions. </seg>
<seg id=179> In the committee, I had the opportunity to refuse to that experts to speak can no nro belong. </seg>
<seg id=180> We also welcome to a large extent, the directives provision, which equal treatment for disabled people also means that corresponding adjustments at work provided by companies. </seg>
<seg id=181> Only in this way can we, discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe effectively. </seg>
<seg id=182> All in all, teaching us a great Anglo-Saxon democracies that racism and discrimination through the Liberal democracy, and not by the reduction and gradual weakening of freedom of expression, freedom of expression, freedom of association and the economic freedoms, be combated. </seg>
<seg id=183> There is a proposal to equality of homosexuality with the Holy before called for. </seg>
<seg id=184> In this way can the European Union, in specific cases, in relation to the discrimination or the treatment of its citizens, is a clearer stance. </seg>
<seg id=185> I would also like to the question of the exception in relation to the religion of them. </seg>
<seg id=186> From various sides have concerns about the potential interpretation of the explanatory statement to Article 1 expressed, which is still rather unclear, in the however, between sexual orientation and sexual behaviour differences. </seg>
<seg id=187> In this way is a hierarchy of discrimination out. </seg>
<seg id=188> In new Caledonia it is because of the colour of their skin in receipt of benefits. </seg>
<seg id=189> Together with the recently adopted directive 2000, this approach of the directive, the desire expressed by the European Union demonstrate, to stand up an open society, the Denkschablonen and, above all, of the in the European history deep-rooted stigma free of racism. </seg>
<seg id=190> So those who say here in this Parliament, the values which we all want to protect, did not in a European directive to be laid down, are in error. </seg>
<seg id=191> This hard-earned success cannot be touched. </seg>
<seg id=192> Finally, the media have a central role in this task. </seg>
<seg id=193> Experience has shown us that the promotion of legislative proposals to combat discrimination essential, but it is not enough. </seg>
<seg id=194> We need a useless bureaucratic prevent confusion, by the Europe only on a purely materialistische, politically correct Community without deeper meaning reduced. </seg>
<seg id=195> This Parliament has, in my opinion, the legislation is actually moderate, which the European Commission wanted to propose, to a Christmas tree ausgeschmÃ¼ckt. </seg>
<seg id=196> Let me first of all to the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for two excellent reports thank. </seg>
<seg id=197> I can also accept your amendments, which both the importance of prevention and also stressed the fight against discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=198> The second category aims to the text of the Commission proposal to clarify the content of, while the third group consists of many of the amendments that this proposal is in line with the in June last year adopted directive against racial discrimination brought to be. </seg>
<seg id=199> In particular, in amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20, it is proposed that the reference to discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin to be deleted. </seg>
<seg id=200> I can their references in amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and not any formal groups of persons cannot accept, because this proposal on the employment only for individuals. </seg>
<seg id=201> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. </seg>
<seg id=202> We can no public support for expect peace-building missions, if our troops are threatened with the weapons that we ourselves have provided. </seg>
<seg id=203> In my own country, I would like without authorisation not even with a Schrotflinte, while I to the opening of the arms trade in my gartenschuppen no approval needed. </seg>
<seg id=204> Another important point is the ban on the export, promotion and marketing of equipment or of know-how, which, first and foremost, for the purposes of torture is used. </seg>
<seg id=205> Having said that, I would like the rapporteur, Mr Titley, on his excellent report, of course, to congratulate. </seg>
<seg id=206> In addition to the issues of binding we must look at the a extended to cover priorities, which is directly aimed at a military use, on disarmament, conversion, intensification of the work of the police and customs and, secondly, at the moment by Mr Wiersma referred to candidate countries. </seg>
<seg id=207> Would control the money circulation, so it would be much more difficult for the arms trade provisions applicable to circumvent. </seg>
<seg id=208> The aim of the annual review is, such potential improvements to identify. </seg>
<seg id=209> The European Union is currently examining whether this project on the project duration, which in the end of November of this year, can continue. </seg>
<seg id=210> It has been a methodology and indicators at the next Council presented ' research '. </seg>
<seg id=211> Thank you, Mr Busquin. </seg>
<seg id=212> With regard to the problems of the kmu we have, of course, ensure that the kmu, as provided for in the budget decision, in the framework programme be properly taken into account. </seg>
<seg id=213> This appears, at least from the debate on the budget herauszukristallisieren in Greece, and many professions are even on the attitude of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=214> With regard to the multidisciplinary nature is concerned, I share your concerns. </seg>
<seg id=215> The first point he explicitly mentioned in his statement, is the participation in the Eu national programmes. </seg>
<seg id=216> We could therefore not speak of a European research area, if we only 5 % of the research budget funding. </seg>
<seg id=217> Thank you, Mr Busquin. </seg>
<seg id=218> On the one hand, was due to the efforts of the funds by the end of the year 1999 to fully commit, at the beginning of this year, the number of the amendments we are to decision for the financing of new projects in accordance with low. </seg>
<seg id=219> However, I would like to stress again that Portugal in the previous period everything to our satisfaction has fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id=220> Question no 2 by (H-0730/00): </seg>
<seg id=221> The definition of fuel tax finally, at a high level has not the case that the Community competition rules are not complied with. </seg>
<seg id=222> Mr maccormick secondly, known as follows: encourage the Member States with fiscal means a certain industrial sector, they violate the rules on state aid, and in this case, fiscal aid, subsidies in some amount to. </seg>
<seg id=223> A clear case of, for example, the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id=224> Subject: budget line minority languages since 1983 existing budget of the European Union in favour of minority languages experienced by 1995 a constant increase and achieved in the year their high with EUR 4 million. </seg>
<seg id=225> Mr President, colleagues in the House will know that the structural funds - and this is new - a great deal of funding for cultural activities cards, because I, together with Michel Barnier keen have that the structural funds, not only in roads and invest in airports, but also in people. </seg>
<seg id=226> The Commission will therefore in next year no further financial commitments. </seg>
<seg id=227> What concrete proposals for financing is concerned, I can at this point, it does not take a position, as we accept the normal way of proceeding. </seg>
<seg id=228> I have several options under consideration. </seg>
<seg id=229> And this is to prevent, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe. </seg>
<seg id=230> Concerning the rules on hunting, for example, the Elchjagd, the treatment of the office for certain meat? </seg>
<seg id=231> We would the rules on meat to apply its gejagten animals, so that meant a bureaucratic disaster for the Elchjagd. </seg>
<seg id=232> After the conclusion of this report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals. In this respect, I shall also to the problem of inadequate enforcement of transport time restrictions comment. </seg>
<seg id=233> We have before this issue at my meeting with the group of the Greens discussed. </seg>
<seg id=234> Our question was clear: what measures is the Commission taking? </seg>
<seg id=235> General product safety also obliges the manufacturer, their clients about possible risks up. </seg>
<seg id=236> The case Maryam ayubi is extremely worrying. </seg>
<seg id=237> Question no 14 by (H-0745/00): </seg>
<seg id=238> The attitude of the Eu in relation to this meeting at ministerial level in Vientiane, of course, to the question of whether there should take place or at what level the Eu should be represented by the developments in Burma until December depend. </seg>
<seg id=239> A final comment. </seg>
<seg id=240> The elections are an important step in the involvement of the inhabitants of Kosovo in shaping their communities. </seg>
<seg id=241> I can assure you that these elections are democratic and better been carried out as elections in our countries, in which I often either took part or in which I, as observers was present. </seg>
<seg id=242> However, we saw it as the beginning and not in any sense the end of the process. </seg>
<seg id=243> It will be a more effective and coherent control of the arms trade and greater transparency in favour. </seg>
<seg id=244> Now point I note that every year more supply contracts for weapons and accessories be closed. </seg>
<seg id=245> On the basis of fictitious information, of virtual realities we cannot relevant decisions. </seg>
<seg id=246> The system in which these activities of one and the same Directorate-General have been made, should be reviewed. </seg>
<seg id=247> These bodies must have the opportunity to set up an internal auditor, indeed, it would be sufficient, the financial controller certain minimum requirements in terms of auditing to impose. </seg>
<seg id=248> This proposal is, as the Commissioner knows very well, in Parliament not to unanimous support. </seg>
<seg id=249> Therefore, nothing against an independent internal audit service, for we are with the report by Mr van Hulten give the green light. </seg>
<seg id=250> Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur. </seg>
<seg id=251> We are of the opinion that the modernisation of administration is urgently needed. </seg>
<seg id=252> An independent against scrutiny is essential in order to avoid mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=253> The money should in future targeted and effective be spent, and, of course, will also be better to ensure that the money is to be spent on the purposes for which it was intended to the budgetary authority. </seg>
<seg id=254> Now to the proposed amendments briefly: the introduction of this additional recital the Commission agrees. </seg>
<seg id=255> I should therefore like to ask for your suggestions and your advice thank. </seg>
<seg id=256> I would like to the proposals contained in this report which, in my view, the most important and most effective, summarise. Firstly, to set up a group of experts from the Member States of appointed senior figures made in order to define recognised parameters for the protection of minors to contribute in the media; secondly, the introduction of a selbstkontroll-kodex by all the television companies; thirdly, possibility of supporting and access to systems both for television and for the Internet. </seg>
<seg id=257> I can the demands of the European Liberal, unfortunately, not agree. </seg>
<seg id=258> It is and remains essentially the responsibility of the legislation of the Member States, but what a konsensuale understanding on certain parameters in dialogue with all those involved in the European level in no way excludes. </seg>
<seg id=259> Under these conditions, in my view, it is the task of the parents, their children at home before programmes of this kind to preserve. </seg>
<seg id=260> Parents in this area are particularly dependent on aid, must include the following elements: parameters for the protection of minors in the media in the whole area of the European Union, the setting up and cost-effective availability of systems, legislation on the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, companies and operators in the private and in the public sector. </seg>
<seg id=261> If, then, in committee debates some say that there is no evidence of the negative influence of the various forms of violence on television on children, then I am surprised and believe that this is a fatal playing down. </seg>
<seg id=262> As regards the introduction of a selbstkontroll-kodex is, above all, from a technical point of view, it should be noted that broadcasters in some Member States already have a kontrollcode for television have drawn up, which should enable parents, the television sets. </seg>
<seg id=263> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=264> Above all, in my report, which in itself praiseworthy generalisations by the return of power to the Member States replaced. </seg>
<seg id=265> That would be the least, in the area of freedom, a fundamental right of every citizen, to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=266> There are delays in payments in 1996. </seg>
<seg id=267> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, for the work he has done thank. </seg>
<seg id=268> I commend this House this report and support the adoption of the put forward by Mr Evans amendments. </seg>
<seg id=269> Our resources are our sole future in a world in which know anything means. </seg>
<seg id=270> And I know a lot more. We will not solve any problems with Â­ grÃ¼n, know Â­ black Â­ or rotbÃ¼chern, but also by means of concrete measures. </seg>
<seg id=271> But Parliament has its function and pressure, so that the researchers, however, be included in the text. </seg>
<seg id=272> Your visit today is taking place at a time for the future of European integration is of great importance. </seg>
<seg id=273> We know, however, that this process is not yet complete and, therefore, is in danger of its vitality to lose. </seg>
<seg id=274> If we do not now, in this difficult and stormy transition phase do the European and world history, when will we do? </seg>
<seg id=275> None of us today can claim to know exactly when and in what order we achieve these objectives, but we are all aware that, if we believe in them and they are persistent, we have half of the way have behind us. </seg>
<seg id=276> We must ensure that women are benefiting from within the induced electric jobs, and not once again the same inequalities as in the more traditional sectors arise must, in other words, less qualified jobs, part-time work on sometimes not voluntary, temporary employment contracts and more difficult access to decision-making positions. </seg>
<seg id=277> The Council with a proposal to the indicators concerned, on the basis of which the relevant progress can be evaluated. </seg>
<seg id=278> In short, the fourth pillar on equal opportunities is a support of the integrated approach of equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines. </seg>
<seg id=279> I am thinking in particular of violence against women, one of the priorities of my government, and I know that this issue you also a particular concern. </seg>
<seg id=280> We know that the measures to reconcile work and family life favour women especially if there is a lack of studies on the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is no longer the traditional role, because the society has greatly changed and, with it, the families structure. </seg>
<seg id=281> Sometimes seem to some people, including some Members in this House, to believe that the but it would be, but this is not true. </seg>
<seg id=282> Mr President, let me conclude by emphasising that the equality within their own four walls begins. </seg>
<seg id=283> Such a position seems to me to be questionable and zwielichtig, and this should, in my view, in relation to the proposed by you be considered projects, because it is not certain that we to practical implementation of reach. </seg>
<seg id=284> In this area there is no equality. </seg>
<seg id=285> The image of the European Mrs, as it is in our reports, is from our directives is not the Danish of women, the euro the majority to reject. </seg>
<seg id=286> So I think it is significant that the report to abhebt in all areas of society, for example in the labour market, should a zahlenmÃ¤Ãiges balance between men and women. </seg>
<seg id=287> That is precisely why it is a missed opportunity that this report marriage and family completely out of eight have been allowed. </seg>
<seg id=288> This should also the Committee on women' s rights and equal opportunities, better heed! </seg>
<seg id=289> We have heard that the Belgian Presidency only restructure the equal status department and then abolished. </seg>
<seg id=290> The average wage for women is on average 28 % below that of men, which will help to ensure that women the majority of the poor population, and their participation in social and political life more difficult. </seg>
<seg id=291> It is truly excellent. </seg>
<seg id=292> Throughout Europe is today a process of the impoverishment of the acquisition of working women, in France, where at least 15 % of you less than 3650 ff a month to live. </seg>
<seg id=293> Not all countries managed to consequences of their example, and I hope that the example of France in other countries will bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id=294> The history of women obviously goes far back. </seg>
<seg id=295> The accession candidates must in the adoption of the acquis communautaire really be helped. </seg>
<seg id=296> I need however their help. </seg>
<seg id=297> That is not the case, but it is a good text, and the Committee on legal Affairs decided after careful consideration and detailed discussion, no amendments to put forward. </seg>
<seg id=298> The Committee on legal Affairs has, after a long debate on the view that it is not appropriate to the legal uncertainty over six years to maintain, and that the deadline of three years a more than adequate period is to deal with the appropriate resources and an average carefully to see whether, in a statement had irregularities or not. </seg>
<seg id=299> This is amendment no 15, which relates to fraud is. </seg>
<seg id=300> The objective, especially a simplified, but qualitative communication on, however, sufficient flexibility of the basic regulation to improve the procedure for the collection of customs duties and greater adapting the provisions relating to the application in customs to achieve a meet the requirements of the single market, and the has been achieved, even in such a way that many countries that have inspiration to quickly in world trade be able to participate. </seg>
<seg id=301> It would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi for the efforts both institutions devoted to this matter, and the interest that it have shown. </seg>
<seg id=302> Welcome </seg>
<seg id=303> I would not like to see the vote will be affected by this, but the translation of the French version really must be reviewed. </seg>
<seg id=304> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report voted. </seg>
<seg id=305> It is recognized that language skills a necessary condition for the mobility. </seg>
<seg id=306> We also think that the Member States, to a large extent, even on the taxation should decide. </seg>
<seg id=307> A little regrets I have that we had no chance of a majority of the need to get a date for the aufbewahren of documents to formulate. </seg>
<seg id=308> (FR) In the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had at the time, the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or (not sectarian) belief, disability, age or sexual orientation welcomed. </seg>
<seg id=309> The problems of certain minorities in these countries is of course all aware. </seg>
<seg id=310> The explanatory statement to the amendment clearly shows that it is the intention is, against the in force in the Member States the age to proceed provisions, but from development psychological reasons are entirely justified and in employment lives of no importance. </seg>
<seg id=311> I also think that everything that in a new Article 12 (a) together written was, for others less so. </seg>
<seg id=312> To religion or creed. The eplp welcomes the principle of the need to this effect. </seg>
<seg id=313> (SV) We Christian Democrats welcome the thrust of the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. </seg>
<seg id=314> But this is just over the personnel of a service of internal auditing and nothing on the financial importance and, therefore, on the use of such a service. </seg>
<seg id=315> The Eu has the construction of a common military jurisdiction, decided to the so-called Petersberg objectives to meet (crises fight and conflict resolution outside the territory of the Eu), but does not have its own defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=316> Without arms the world would be a much safer. </seg>
<seg id=317> The motion for a resolution is not intended to a drastic reduction in the arms sales to promote a policy of abrÃ¼stens, but I would simply like to rules take the armaments companies continue to profit. </seg>
<seg id=318> In its communication, the Commission recognises the problem, however, proposing any specific measures, because they the idea of the liberalisation of the market and of competition is arrested. All your proposals are basically in the, particularly for children - harsh reality of the unaccountability of multinational enterprises over, which it in their pursuit of profit is indifferent to the effects of its programmes and products, and the any buck-passing responsibilities of the parents, who even to acquire new products to be encouraged, in order to protect their children. </seg>
<seg id=319> As the rapporteur, I am also of the opinion that the measures for the protection of young people from violent and harmful programmes no longer to restrict the traditional television, but for all the media must apply. </seg>
<seg id=320> With an average three hours a day television is in addition to the schlafen and, for adults in addition to the work - the most important human activity. </seg>
<seg id=321> Furthermore, occupy women often ' flexible ' jobs; fixed-term contracts and low wages are typical of the sectors in which mainly women are employed. </seg>
<seg id=322> You are the first victims in the reduction of public funds, privatisation in the health sector, the restriction of the right to health care and medical treatment, cuts, which still tangible, the right to prevention and information programmes. </seg>
<seg id=323> B5-0792/2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal group of the European United left/Nordic Green left, on the crisis in Peru. </seg>
<seg id=324> Mr President, I would like in fact that we are once again, not only in the context of one or other of urgency, but for a well-prepared debate in the committees a debate on Latin America have. </seg>
<seg id=325> We must make every effort to Peru with candidates can achieve the objective of equal to the challenge and are in a position to the request of the Peruvian people for political renewal and substantial democracy to play. </seg>
<seg id=326> The joint debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=327> We now know, Afghanistan is not far from Afghanistan is the biggest producer of opium in the world, so that we can imagine what role these political, and not just political mafias - in the extension of drug trafficking play. </seg>
<seg id=328> The Commission will to an assessment of the humanitarian aid programmes asked for the benefit of the Afghan people, so that nobody on the ground forget. </seg>
<seg id=329> This conflict is suffering. </seg>
<seg id=330> For years, there is a budget line, in the framework of MinenrÃ¤um- and prevention programmes are funded. </seg>
<seg id=331> Let me at this point to the reference by Mrs Paciotti say that I, of course, still within the Commission will put the question of what with the resources for mine clearance is done and should be done. </seg>
<seg id=332> B5-0794/2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, linksohr and Fava, on behalf of the group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction of the guerrillas in the negotiations Spanish Jesuiten in Colombia; </seg>
<seg id=333> We all regret this and we would like not again on Colombia to speak. </seg>
<seg id=334> The Commission has already offered the measures such a package to coordinate. The Commission intends in the next few days already considerable resources to promise. </seg>
<seg id=335> Once again, therefore, double standards, which is regrettable think. </seg>
<seg id=336> Particularly incomprehensible to me is the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, closing it is here aware of the need for a solution to a problem Albanian in Macedonia. </seg>
<seg id=337> I think it is an extraordinary achievement of the Macedonians, within their own country together clear. </seg>
<seg id=338> That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can be kept, but the government, with great courage a solution to the university question and many other issues has found needs visible signs of success and needs strong support, otherwise is peace in the region as a whole at risk. </seg>
<seg id=339> In the context of the national programme for the year 2000 Phare funds allocated can also to support the university next academic year, 2001 and 2002, be used. </seg>
<seg id=340> I must stress that now all the Greek Members of the European Parliament on this issue have expressed. </seg>
<seg id=341> Since all these problems affect Greece, which has the largest maritime sector in the European Union has to deal with it, in fact, the security of every kind of shipping in the Union as a whole. </seg>
<seg id=342> In recent years in our waters are far more people have lost their lives, not only by large FÃ¤hrunglÃ¼cke, but all too often in our fishing communities. </seg>
<seg id=343> On the contrary, innocent victims must now be used, so that the shipowners its objectives in the broadest sense prevail. </seg>
<seg id=344> We must be aware that this is also about the credibility of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=345> Finally, I would stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of the European legislation on the safety of ships a matter of the highest priority in the European Union must be and that it is important to ensure that this legislation throughout the Community applied strictly and consistently. </seg>
<seg id=346> Please excuse that I, for reasons which you are well aware, was a little late. I would like to make a brief statement on the two items on the agenda make: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general and the situation in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=347> Commissioner Verheugen will as Mr Solana on the two issues, this afternoon we have on our agenda, namely the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id=348> We must be ready to deliver on this promise when respect the will of the people. </seg>
<seg id=349> Madam President, Mr hoher representative, Commissioner, I contribute to this debate not without reservations, I wanted to not that our Parliament in view of the dramatic consequences of the new violence outbreak in the Middle East, just one month after the here in this Chamber so confident expectations, today exclusively as a judge who, is entitled to this or that to be condemned. </seg>
<seg id=350> Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kinds of far from analyses, but in my own experience of the last week, because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, when there to the violence outbreaks took place. </seg>
<seg id=351> Also as an opponent of violence can be the violence of the Israelis and the Palestinians not to the same weight. </seg>
<seg id=352> I would like to ask the House at this crucial time, a declaration of solidarity with the to adopt brave people that today in the streets of Belgrade has to defend the freedom of the same solidarity, which we Europeans a few years ago the capitals of other people have given, which also for their freedom struggle. </seg>
<seg id=353> The Europeans would no doubt be well advised to us here in this House by the President of the Palestinian legislative Council the opportunity to use to take. </seg>
<seg id=354> The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=355> For years it has managed, with its propaganda and with brutal pressure on the media to deceive people in his country, but also, unfortunately, in many of the western world, you a false picture of reality vorzuspiegeln. </seg>
<seg id=356> As the curtain falls to this tragedy, it is the duty of this Parliament as a symbol of a United, free Europe, the masses to support before the Yugoslav parliament and Mr KostunÃ­ca in the performance and delivery of its mandate to help. </seg>
<seg id=357> Is this attitude irreconcilable is, at the same time, schlimmste fear - and the events of this moment stress these words, which I a couple of hours ago have noted. </seg>
<seg id=358> I question me whether the Commissioner on this point plans already taken steps in order to show that we Kostunica really as the legally elected representatives of the Serbian people view and as a partner with which the European Union now has to do. </seg>
<seg id=359> The European Parliament would like to him at this historic moment, since the tyranny shake and democracy, triumphiert its full solidarity declaring. </seg>
<seg id=360> The next item is the debate on the report by (A5-0237/2000) Mr SeppÃ¤nen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending decision 2000/24/eg with regard to the extension of the Community guarantee granted to the European investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (KOM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)). </seg>
<seg id=361> The following the parliamentary and presidential elections in this country has new political line is to be welcomed. </seg>
<seg id=362> It is working on a beratende task force, whose aim is to Croatia their competence and technical assistance in the Treaty negotiations to offer. </seg>
<seg id=363> We must not forget that Croatia until recently the classic example of a totally failed privatisation programme was, in which only a few of the privatisation have benefited. This whole process must be supported. </seg>
<seg id=364> The under discussion contribution in the form of a eib-darlehens on EUR 250 million for the period 2000-2007, this can no milestone, but a befÃ¶rdernde aid. </seg>
<seg id=365> It is not therefore entirely correct perhaps to in this report by the democratisation of the speech. </seg>
<seg id=366> As Croatia and Slovakia half a century ago, for the first time in particular have been independent, they were servants of the Hitler regime. </seg>
<seg id=367> We can, of course, the question of the guarantees and the Croatia issue is not separated from the debate yesterday evening, and the development in Belgrade see. </seg>
<seg id=368> If it is true that Milosevic is fled and the will of the people has gained the upper hand, then we hope that it to the practical inclusion partnership normal relations between Serbia and our Union of democracies have only days takes. </seg>
<seg id=369> I declare the Friday, 6 October 2000 resumed the session of the European Parliament to be resumed. </seg>
<seg id=370> (the House rose and observed a minute' s silence) </seg>
<seg id=371> My question is: who is entitled, on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute to speak? </seg>
<seg id=372> I would ask you, Madam President, to companies all possible steps to the current procedures in the Committee on Petitions in relation to the of more than thirty social groups and nro protests tabled, in which the petitioners to speak against the current situation in the Community legislation on radiation protection flagrantly violated, to speed up. </seg>
<seg id=373> The autopsie made in Georgia has shown that it is clearly a question of murder, probably in connection with torture, has acted. </seg>
<seg id=374> We have the opportunity to their dream - in other not think, is a major step forward. </seg>
<seg id=375> This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation of genetically modified plants. </seg>
<seg id=376> It is clear from a fettnÃ¤pfchen to the other. </seg>
<seg id=377> (the sitting was suspended at 540 p.m. and at 550 p.m. resumed.) </seg>
<seg id=378> The next item is the report by (A5-0291/2000) Mrs van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on employment and social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, (KOM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS)) the European Parliament, the economic and social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the social policy agenda. </seg>
<seg id=379> The importance of this open method of coordination highlight does not mean that this method should to the place of social legislation, because we in Europe set social rights, minimum social standards to formulate dare and social legislation must be adopted within the framework of a European internal market are needed. </seg>
<seg id=380> We are in our opinion also for dialogue and cooperation with civil society and, above all, with the women' sassociations in the countries which are currently to their accession to prepare our European family, because there in time we must take a harmonious development, which in theory and in practice the example of the rest of Europe is. </seg>
<seg id=381> To the listed in the Commission' s communication activities fields also there is general agreement. </seg>
<seg id=382> At this point in my speech I would like to remind you of a seminar, the on this subject on 4 and 5 December will be held in Biarritz, and which I chair will. </seg>
<seg id=383> With regard to the fight against exclusion we have on 17 October at the Council " employment and social Affairs " made great progress and appropriate objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, defined as the basis of the national action plans are intended to serve. </seg>
<seg id=384> In some quarters I have heard that it after the of the report lesen the diagnosis, but not the imposition of recipe agrees. </seg>
<seg id=385> The development of technology and the new organizational forms speak certainly also for a flexible cooperation in the less rigid procedures rules, but rather on objectives and results. </seg>
<seg id=386> What is, in our view, due to the old-fashioned views of those who are charged by a liberalised market not expect him all the best regulates. </seg>
<seg id=387> This is a very important contribution to social peace in our country contributed and confidence in foreign direct investors consolidated. </seg>
<seg id=388> The method adopted, however, it seems to me to be rather questionable. </seg>
<seg id=389> When we talk of a Charter of fundamental rights and a European constitution are favourably, we must not be short-sighted, but need to say is that all necessary steps must be taken, even if it exakterer rules need. </seg>
<seg id=390> Critical note, I would like to lack of initiatives to the new challenges in the health and safety in the employee participation and in the labour relations. </seg>
<seg id=391> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister PÃ©ry to this presentation of the social policy agenda congratulate. </seg>
<seg id=392> We know that these points by the Conservative be combated in Europe. However, we in our group, attach particular importance to it. </seg>
<seg id=393> The third feature of substance concerns enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=394> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m. </seg>
<seg id=395> The measures the Commission should by a review of the impact of the access for individuals to medical care, social security and the pension system, as well as a study of the shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also the question of a general reduction in working hours be supplemented. </seg>
<seg id=396> In this way will the women Europe close to feel, but also Europe will be of benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas from the commitment to this programme will come. </seg>
<seg id=397> We expect an annual report by the President of the Commission in the context of a debate every year in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=398> I am also pleased that an improvement in the measures to child care is provided for, which the reconciliation of professional and family life should facilitate. </seg>
<seg id=399> My group is in its final vote taken into account. </seg>
<seg id=400> (the President cut the speaker off) </seg>
<seg id=401> I believe that the new approach, the Commission is very positive and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005 well thought out. </seg>
<seg id=402> In my opinion, the many of us, amendments supported the common position adopted by the Commission and the Committee on women' s rights in this matter play. </seg>
<seg id=403> I have, on the one hand, in the course of the last year questions received a number of companies that a degree of impotence in connection with the investigation have seen, not least in those cases in which an appeal against the decision of the Commission before the Court of first instance had to be. </seg>
<seg id=404> I would also like to take the opportunity to Commissioner Monti issues, when the implementation of a public, effective and efficient register of state aid is to be expected and, moreover, when the long prospects of receiving scoreboard will be implemented. </seg>
<seg id=405> Furthermore, I would Mr Monti to point out that the credit industry in the next report to be given broader scope should. </seg>
<seg id=406> What I said, is not only in the field of energy policy, but, overall, it also applies to other areas. </seg>
<seg id=407> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they with the two reports, in which they a complimentary assessment of the activities of their person and make the Directorate-General for competition, have done. </seg>
<seg id=408> I stress this because the market does not everything can rules and it is in this spirit, not unlimited competition is and must be. </seg>
<seg id=409> Mr President, no one denies today - and I of course not - that the state aid change the conditions of competition and so bad in that they are the inefficiency of companies benefit. </seg>
<seg id=410> So at least it was quite strange to hear that he the decline in state aid in the period 1994-1998 abstreitet, even though the Commission itself this year. </seg>
<seg id=411> My opinion is, of course, the xxix. The Commission' s report on competition policy, but we shall now again not fail to look to the past. </seg>
<seg id=412> In of the time available to me, I should like to highlight the following three points: modernisation of Community competition law, work in 1999 to enforce the competition rules and, finally, the state aid. </seg>
<seg id=413> The Commission has always decided against Kartellbildungen and against the abuse of a dominant position intervention. </seg>
<seg id=414> Mr Rapkay, the Commission attaches great importance to the support of its competition policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support is falling. </seg>
<seg id=415> This system can either at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European communities, be activated a provision which during the third phase of economic and monetary union only for the Member States with a derogation, which is currently in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden. </seg>
<seg id=416> In future if the recourse to the capital market the only possible option remain. </seg>
<seg id=417> I therefore ask that the report in its present form the support of the House and that, therefore, in the area of the European internal market rebpflanzgutes can be used. </seg>
<seg id=418> That they must now be changed, is on the development of the phytosanitary rules and on the result of scientific and technical progress, especially in the in vitro increase have been achieved. </seg>
<seg id=419> By this precautionary principle also to the possibility of genetic changes referred, can, for example, the intensive use of pesticides be reduced. </seg>
<seg id=420> Finally, I would like to say that we in the interests precautionary principle, if the I have just referred to Article and amendments unfortunately not should be withdrawn, then, as we also call for the wine growers, the view of Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and therefore of the Committee on the environment, public health and consumer protection, consequences and for their deletion should vote in favour. </seg>
<seg id=421> Mr President, if you allow: Commissioner, could you give us its opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy set out? It is amendment no 1. </seg>
<seg id=422> The only controversial point was whether I the decree on the withdrawal of Mr Le Pen' s parliamentary mandate immediately after its transmission by the French government had to take Minutes or not to. </seg>
<seg id=423> I would remind you that this vote only at 12.30 a.m. </seg>
<seg id=424> In the field of justice and home affairs I am optimistic about a solution to the civil judicial cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=425> The preparatory group for their role will be fully until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level, continue. </seg>
<seg id=426> We need such a calls climate, as Mr Moscovici said, and I have with the Heads of State and government the strong feeling of a common, historic responsibility at a historic moment the European agreement can play. </seg>
<seg id=427> We only need to ensure that we now in these issues of qualified majority not behind the spirit or the climate of Biarritz lagging behind. </seg>
<seg id=428> The small countries are not the agent of the large countries of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=429> I would the President-in-Office grateful if he clarify this point. </seg>
<seg id=430> On the one hand, was the presence of President Kostunica an historic event. </seg>
<seg id=431> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, we are to make progress on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting has been achieved, but there are profound differences of opinion with regard to the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out. </seg>
<seg id=432> It seems to me rather that we in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id=433> Who is not with closer cooperation, the freedoms of mitfahrers on the back seat of a vehicle. </seg>
<seg id=434> I would also like to not, even less than you, interfere in Germany' sdomestic affairs, but I am of the opinion that this position is totally coherent and the other in the direction desired by the Commission is, if I am not mistaken. </seg>
<seg id=435> We have an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue started to the effect that all the Member States to maintain this ceiling after enlargement support. </seg>
<seg id=436> This will certainly not be the case. </seg>
<seg id=437> Firstly, we sometimes have the impression that, in Biarritz a certain obsession of the debate between small and large states has governed. </seg>
<seg id=438> In this regard, it is my view that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be respected. </seg>
<seg id=439> Even after the accession of the current candidate countries, each Member State must a senior Commissioner junior- or keep. </seg>
<seg id=440> The wording of Article 93 is particularly problematic in view of the fact that, after the initial successful wave' sas well as will be impossible, progress in the direction of qualified majority voting to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=441> The citizens of these countries must of the undoubted advantages, the any new European treaty brings convinced. </seg>
<seg id=442> It is the deep reason to ignore this crisis, we wanted to accept that the for generations' sfears without new shocks a definitive peace, the precondition for reconciliation is place could make. </seg>
<seg id=443> I am also concerned the only right weak response to Parliament' s call for democratisation. </seg>
<seg id=444> It is surely rather the forces be accused of the before the enlargement of the implementation of comprehensive reforms demand. </seg>
<seg id=445> On the one hand, the decision by the government of Israel, the peace talks due to the use of force in the area freeze and its efforts on the creation of an emergency government with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon, to focus. </seg>
<seg id=446> Of course we were delighted to unspeakable the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostunica the President noted. </seg>
<seg id=447> I commend Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, his Italian colleague, but for a reason to ask why it is in Italy with a very Communist Party of part of the government and with another very Communist Party, the Partito Della Rifondazione comunista, to take part in the parliamentary elections prepare. </seg>
<seg id=448> It should progress here in the codecision procedure. </seg>
<seg id=449> The Commission is with the possibility of a simple majority of votes in the Commission rather in a position to do so, this impetus in the future. </seg>
<seg id=450> Now in the Union needed no visionÃ¤re, the view of the year 2030 is fixed, but people with solutions which are able to see the problems which the within 3 to 8 years is to bewerkstelligende enlargement, and answers to be found. </seg>
<seg id=451> Therefore, it is an open under conditions of work carried out, not from the top set or has been implemented. </seg>
<seg id=452> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=453> Is this fundamental reference lost, it is, at best, not more, at worst is one another. </seg>
<seg id=454> Democracy it is better in Europe, but the European democracy that. </seg>
<seg id=455> Today, the European Parliament has, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg made a simple and strong message: yes, you can achieve the European Constitution, yes, we want it. </seg>
<seg id=456> It is an island in itself a sufficient criterion. </seg>
<seg id=457> I am going to restrict myself to the heart of the matter, by I myself to the essential points of the report by Mr chairman, Gil Robles to focus on which I would like to say briefly that I it excellent think. </seg>
<seg id=458> Firstly, simplifying and clarifying the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=459> I would leave it at that, because the report of the Florence Hochschulinstituts is here - at least for me - not for discussion. </seg>
<seg id=460> The information that - it is now very technical, you see me the request for - which have the presidency, appears in a clear majority of the language versions in contrast to the Italian version of the implementation of the cohesion policy only on the least favoured islands and not on the islands in general to be made. </seg>
<seg id=461> Mr Duhamel, you will agree with me in saying that, if Nice is not the success, no place, or at least not credibility for reflection on the future of the European integration is, at least not in the current context. </seg>
<seg id=462> It is also in the European Constitution necessary, the distribution of competences between the Member States and the European Union to define clear and the dynamic of European integration in areas to include, where it is essential to act jointly, as in the field of foreign and security policy. </seg>
<seg id=463> It could also be necessary in order to persistent blockages to overcome. </seg>
<seg id=464> We need a clearer distribution of responsibilities and a clearer principle of subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=465> As you know, there are very different opinions in the various Member States, in the various social partners. </seg>
<seg id=466> The Endzweck a European Constitution would, however, sadly, precisely the opposite, and that is why we cannot accept it. </seg>
<seg id=467> Because in the greater European House will it peoples on military, on monetary and possibly on fiscal table, and then the other, the sidelines. </seg>
<seg id=468> The second version is clearly not the case, because on the one hand, the economically backward areas already covered by the structural funds and, on the other after this interpretation no reason for the adoption of the declaration 30 have been. </seg>
<seg id=469> Mr President, I will speak in my modest short 60 seconds to the report by Olivier Duhamel focus, which is an excellent one, because it things really name. And the lyrismus our rapporteur has just finally convince us. </seg>
<seg id=470> In my view, the unity of Europe only be a political. </seg>
<seg id=471> We think that the new Constitution already available to the next European elections and can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id=472> Consequently, the term ' most disadvantaged " both on the island regions and also applied to the other areas, and after the proposal by Mr Barnier we must, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention of Vienna, to make a modification of the Italian text. </seg>
<seg id=473> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=474> Because the Mrs said that you wanted to vote against this amendment lapses. </seg>
<seg id=475> Mr President, we are seeking here, it is clear that after a recipe for chaos. </seg>
<seg id=476> (EN) I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by Parliament, it is high standards of quality and safety standards for derivatives from blood or plasma note. </seg>
<seg id=477> If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, would have the French authorities with the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Le Pen for us to go. </seg>
<seg id=478> I am particularly disappointed by the vote of the ep in the report on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine. </seg>
<seg id=479> The a keep alcohol as tobacco and drugs for a product that in consumers and their fellow human beings can cause great damage to the other, see it as a means of creating jobs and a sprudelnde resource. </seg>
<seg id=480> The rapporteur welcomes in general in the White Paper the Commission' s proposals on this issue is, however, concerned about the possible impact of the reform, the basic aim of the enforcement of competition rules to decentralise. </seg>
<seg id=481> In the debate yesterday evening, I Jonathan Evans on his work, but I had to begin by my clear criticism of the European Liberal, if not ultra-liberal orientation of his report speak. </seg>
<seg id=482> The interconnection that emphasis has redirected in order in the next three years, half of all new in projects on the Greens fields jobs being created in the objective 1 region to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=483> In view of the indignation, the consequences of the cause of this policy, sometimes it will be possible, with the help of state intervention, aid and other economic or tax incentives the situation, at least in part, to defuse. </seg>
<seg id=484> (the sitting was suspended at 206 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=485> So we are now in October 2000 on the eve of the decision on the figures structure of the budget 2001. </seg>
<seg id=486> But that has the Council not prevented from, in the overall expenditure 555 million euros to reduce. </seg>
<seg id=487> Also, of course, we are of the opinion that not 400 posts simply in addition must be created, simply high on the point. </seg>
<seg id=488> The Council, I can only say that it consequences us! </seg>
<seg id=489> That is why the administration of this House for the Members here and not the other way round. </seg>
<seg id=490> The European Court of Auditors makes us at the time of the least concern. </seg>
<seg id=491> Finally, the budget for the Ombudsman of us to deal with. </seg>
<seg id=492> On the contrary, we believe that, particularly in relation to the candidate countries will be pushed the research should. </seg>
<seg id=493> We also propose that Parliament regularly informed. </seg>
<seg id=494> And if a legislative conciliation on social Affairs, to culture or the environment should be held, the Commissioner will I agree with - then we are working together, the Commissioner for the budget, the finance ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets, in order to work together to pray that no financial inconsistency is committed. </seg>
<seg id=495> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome. </seg>
<seg id=496> On the contrary, it has already at first reading of the budget approved the him for 2001 seem justified, without making in tactical considerations, the objective of a proper use of funds, the Community institutions must continue to strive for, only detrimental to would have been. </seg>
<seg id=497> Before you on the budget 2001 decide, I would like to highlight number of objectives, on the agreement between the Council and Parliament, and the to an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority can lead. </seg>
<seg id=498> In the field of structural policy, we are in a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id=499> Also the conciliation in the summer, it has Mr Colom i Naval pointed out, had a good result, namely that in future, better information on expenditure effective legal bases Parliament also be made available. </seg>
<seg id=500> I would remind you that, in the last year approved financial perspective for the Balkans only 1.85 billion for the whole of the period until 2006 were. </seg>
<seg id=501> I would ask you once again, therefore, the Commission' s proposal is on the table - that this proposal to look calmly and as an opportunity to consider. </seg>
<seg id=502> The material was both for the programming of the budget for 2001 and for the discharge for the year 1999 appears to be very useful. </seg>
<seg id=503> So much I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets appreciate the work of this body and, much as I also the work of the rapporteur and pay tribute to the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets, I want to it, as rapporteur for the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs, but not to fail to highlight two amendments which the Committee in plenary again presented and which, despite minor amounts not very significant. </seg>
<seg id=504> With these measures we want the legal control again make fully operational, confidence in the legal certainty of the Eu restore and the European Union as a community of law consolidate. </seg>
<seg id=505> The of the Commission' simmediate withdrawal of this initiative has been a clear failure to respect the political will of the Lisbon and the priority of this House. </seg>
<seg id=506> This decision was very strange, and many of us with the feeling back that this important programme simply at the mercy between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission had become. </seg>
<seg id=507> My third point is the European agricultural policy, as they are now in the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id=508> If the employment is a political priority for the Union, then, the fishing as another economic sector not left out. </seg>
<seg id=509> I am particularly pleased that the funding for the end of last Sokrates programmes adopted, youth and culture 2000 guaranteed could be. </seg>
<seg id=510> The delays in our resources sea aid, for example, amount to the budgets of several years. </seg>
<seg id=511> Mr President, in recent years I was the spokesman of the Committee on culture, youth, education, the media and sport, on whose behalf this afternoon Mrs Iivari referred. </seg>
<seg id=512> But I would like to the Members of this afternoon also say that we do not lose sight of the fact is that the Eu only 1 % of consumption bip and a large proportion of this is administered in the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=513> Let me now the general strategy to address. </seg>
<seg id=514> Here I would now in the strategy reached my group, because the starting point of our convictions is the desire for the European citizens as a favourable costs use relation to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=515> On the contrary, we need to work towards a Parliament which, for transparency, efficiency and an effective democratic control of the European institutions entry. </seg>
<seg id=516> We must consider how we solve this problem. </seg>
<seg id=517> We want to promote democratisation processes, and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional policy areas of foreign policy, which we now have before us. </seg>
<seg id=518> The biggest problem in the new draft budget is the external action. </seg>
<seg id=519> Sparsames economies is necessary, of course, we support, and that we should not, cheat. </seg>
<seg id=520> This is an extraordinary initiative, particularly in the first reading, and it is a thankless initiative, because it under the present circumstances are not majority. </seg>
<seg id=521> Nevertheless, the size of the budget approach to Kosovo a number of problems. </seg>
<seg id=522> With the budgetary policy we need the confidence of the citizens in the European policy win. </seg>
<seg id=523> All measures to strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises are therefore support. </seg>
<seg id=524> The extent of the implementation of the budget, </seg>
<seg id=525> Retains we this strategic line as approach to the budgets of this and in the next few years, then Parliament adopted its place in the budgetary procedure fully. </seg>
<seg id=526> With the transfer of EUR 175 million we have about EUR 25 million more available than we expected. </seg>
<seg id=527> On the subject of Meda, the Council stated that the commitments are not a problem, because eight years late payments been accumulated. </seg>
<seg id=528> I believe, Mr Duff was here this morning, when we in the European Council in Biarritz mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=529> My answer is quite simple. </seg>
<seg id=530> Ramiro Zapata was the last of the murdered 25 human rights defenders, and recently published the Colombian press plan 100 ' the paramilitary groups, after the 100 human rights activists have been murdered should. </seg>
<seg id=531> The present attitude of the Council agrees with me rather happier than the July, but it seems to the European Union, as we already in many situations experienced international always be last in to enter phenomenon and its voice heard. </seg>
<seg id=532> My question is, and I will end here, whether there is no opportunity to exert greater pressure, as the President has proposed in its information, and whether the aid that we want to make of the help of the United States in this respect fundamental distinction that it is not on the fumigation of plantations, but on the other cultures after and not to the military, but on the social aspects is. </seg>
<seg id=533> The I and the other Members ' questions relating specifically to the situation in Colombia. </seg>
<seg id=534> As they deal with the same subject, questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 taken together. </seg>
<seg id=535> Subject: tax on financial transactions, the demand for a tax on speculative capital gains in the last few months more and more ground. So many have been Attac committees (association pour an taxation sur les transactions financiÃ¨res et pour l ' aide aux citoyens) in France and Europe used, and in the French national Assembly and in the Senate amendments tabled. </seg>
<seg id=536> Furthermore, we should also answers to the question of the impact on the volatility of exchange markets would, especially at a rate of 0.1 %, while the speculators of devaluation of the order of 20 to 50 % expect. </seg>
<seg id=537> In paragraph 26 it calls for the further the establishment of an international schiedsorganisation to cancel the debt of the countries of the South. </seg>
<seg id=538> The was, moreover, in the year scale the euro the case, irrespective of whether it is to be regretted or welcomed. </seg>
<seg id=539> What Danielle Auroi earlier with regard to the countries of the South has said, I would like to add that the estimates of specialists contain interesting figures, for example, that a tax in the nature of the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 billion dollars would provide, while according to the calculations of the undp USD 40 billion per year would be enough to a minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people to ensure that in the countries of the third world is in short supply. </seg>
<seg id=540> In the last few months, the disease, among other things in different parts of France have. </seg>
<seg id=541> Now, as the representative of the French Presidency is here, I would like to know whether the slaughter of cows from the eu-haushalt or from the national budget is being paid and whether it is appropriate after its opinion, from the eu-haushalt to pay. </seg>
<seg id=542> I would ask you to give its consent, that you are now to be answered. </seg>
<seg id=543> The room for manoeuvre in the two concerned government is therefore by international law limited. </seg>
<seg id=544> I mystery, as the Commission is already in February can comment on what it needs, and the Council in July. </seg>
<seg id=545> If the Union, in the name of subsidiarity, such an approach to the day, does it is in fact a it ought to task, as it in the last few weeks in both the north and in Spain has done. </seg>
<seg id=546> How can I, as a Member of the European Parliament, which the majority of hearts, allow 11.5 billion pounds from British taxpayers ' money - that is our current year contribution - to be spent, if the general public not behind it? </seg>
<seg id=547> With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council could an agreement at second reading will be found for the budget to be concluded. </seg>
<seg id=548> If people still need to be convinced, as he am looking at the evidence. </seg>
<seg id=549> Joan Colom i Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings, this strategy has already presented. </seg>
<seg id=550> As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned, contains the year' s draft budget many political messages. The reform of the agricultural policy, new structural programmes, security and better implementation of structural policy, implementation of the decisions of the Lisbon Summit to create a stronger and more competitive Eu and to combat social exclusion. </seg>
<seg id=551> The NATO war has too much destruction and suffering left. </seg>
<seg id=552> Despite the agreements entered into question I sometimes, whether it is possible that this objective in the context of achieving the existing budgetary constraints, without the agricultural budget for a sustainable agricultural sector in the present Member States is essential to undermine. </seg>
<seg id=553> And I have you clearly replied: Kostunica must be given its opportunity and will then I hope that in the next few weeks or months and to ensure an amnesty, but now I am all in favour of that, at political level and in terms of the budget of the introduction of these two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions. </seg>
<seg id=554> The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: the people have finally enough the dictator Milosevic, and they have confidence in Professor kostunica. </seg>
<seg id=555> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners soon be released. </seg>
<seg id=556> If we do not do that, it will inevitably lead to a financial perspective " aim to redistribution and cuts both in the general, social and environmental expenditure and in the cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=557> There are initiatives to resolve the major social problems, such as the for example unemployment, asked. </seg>
<seg id=558> I stage, of course, a fact as enormously important, namely that we started heading 4, you have tackled. Still, however, is not entirely clear whether there are now a solution managed to not, therefore, because the Council is by no means enough work is willing. </seg>
<seg id=559> In all budget work, it is important to set priorities. </seg>
<seg id=560> This is with a view to the expiry of the Treaty in the near future, not very serious, but it would be worrying if the following on the egks legal framework the opportunity to continue to give such practices. </seg>
<seg id=561> This leads to my third point, which is now before us. </seg>
<seg id=562> The new financial agreement that is not ago. Distrust of the politicians in the Eu growing, so I understand. </seg>
<seg id=563> For this, you deserve recognition. </seg>
<seg id=564> The dialogue all the institutions concerned has enabled an unprecedented cooperation, which we, which I sincerely hope will allow me, in the first reading to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id=565> We in the European values in a country eu-skeptischen are now have a further argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, for the citizens in the modern society is of great importance. </seg>
<seg id=566> I have noticed that in my own country now an amendment of the law on personal data should be carried out by the influence of the House to the decisions of the Commission alone. </seg>
<seg id=567> In a number of other points, we also see problems. Here the judgment must be seen practice, to be sure. </seg>
<seg id=568> (FR) The Commission would first like to refer to the commitment that we all to the citizens, the protection of the institutions of personal data processed to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=569> With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation solely to the activities in the framework of the first pillar is restricted. </seg>
<seg id=570> In accordance with the political agreement, which the Commission with the Council and the rapporteur for adoption has reached at first reading, it will therefore any further amendment, not by the Committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights approved by Paciotti report is reject, apart from amendment no 69 to correct of amendment no 41. </seg>
<seg id=571> It is therefore vital that the staff of the service put on radical group within the general secretariat of the Commission will be increased immediately, so that all the proposals of legislation with general scope for your consideration by the College, on the basis of Article 299 (2) of a detailed impact assessment attached. </seg>
<seg id=572> From the point of view of the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market, it is very important to me to stress that we really only the equal treatment can, which is the same. </seg>
<seg id=573> In view of the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions saddens me this very much. </seg>
<seg id=574> Since under the presidency of Mr Delors an interdepartmental group for the outermost regions has been set up, we have had a long and fruitful journey, and I must, of this group has led to the heartfelt thanks to the Europeans living in extreme peripheral express. </seg>
<seg id=575> So although already contained in the Treaty of Rome a reference to the French overseas departments, but it took until 1989 and to the posei-programmen, the programmes for a solution to the specifically to remoteness and insularity currency problems, by the European Union finally acknowledged that the immutable nature and the hefty action of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions a special treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community justified. </seg>
<seg id=576> I have no doubt that the proposals which the Commission will present to the Council, of these characteristics be marked. </seg>
<seg id=577> This question is all the more relevant, ever closer to the eu-osterweiterung is. </seg>
<seg id=578> This right to differentiation is nothing more than a result of the principle of equality, therefore it is different to deal with what is different. </seg>
<seg id=579> It is a document that my team and I, as poor of ideas and proposals look at the heart of the pyramid problems and none of the issues on which is in the outermost regions cause for concern. </seg>
<seg id=580> In her report, Mrs Sudre, is right to the need for a permanent action highlighted. </seg>
<seg id=581> In the revitalisation of the economic diversification we have in a number of essential areas of progress. </seg>
<seg id=582> Now it is important that a large number of projects within the framework of the proposed eppd, but in parallel to this activity on the ground, we have to the specific needs of the specific access each of these outermost regions fully analysed. </seg>
<seg id=583> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting </seg>
<seg id=584> I will, of course, the President, on your reference information. </seg>
<seg id=585> I am concerned about the fact that many be equipment and the decisions of the House in question could be, because the necessary arrangements for such a case lack. </seg>
<seg id=586> Both these food authority and the we put forward legislative proposals, which aimed to guarantee the safety of food, will receive the support of this Parliament, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=587> The main focus of its activities is on the scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must equally to led an objective basis. </seg>
<seg id=588> Mr President, I should not like to miss this opportunity to the rapporteur for his constructive work and for his willingness to take into account the opinions of the other committees, to thank. </seg>
<seg id=589> If we are faced with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied. </seg>
<seg id=590> What the still controversial issue concerns the extent to which we in the remit of this agency issues such as food and the advice and support of the authorities which are carrying out the management should include, we are of the opinion that this authority for food standards in all aspects of food safety at least should be given the opportunity to express an opinion and their support to offer. </seg>
<seg id=591> Of key importance is the preservation of the rich traditions. </seg>
<seg id=592> Such recognition it is not through legislation, not by rules, but by integrity, by scientific excellence, by independence, by accountability, transparency and comprehensibility by. </seg>
<seg id=593> Good scientific knowledge are certainly essential, given the risks associated with the food chain, from farm to table, better would like to assess. </seg>
<seg id=594> Mr President, there is no doubt that the setting up of a European food safety agency, as our rapporteur it would like to mention, generally supports. </seg>
<seg id=595> If the who programme continue to the necessary resources and receive the necessary support, we do not need additional agency. This applies especially to an agency with a to the 15 Member States of the European Union so limited scope. </seg>
<seg id=596> Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because consumers want to eat healthy, and we must make it our concern. </seg>
<seg id=597> If we do not get a new framework directive, we will have a great deal in the area of food safety can only LÃ¤cheln. </seg>
<seg id=598> Consequently, changes are needed in eu-vertrag, so that the Commission sanctions in the area of food in be given, as they are already in the field of competition. </seg>
<seg id=599> I support all the partners involved, whether in political, administrative or in other trÃ¤gerschaften in the strategy " food for all ' work. </seg>
<seg id=600> I agree with this statement not to, as a person precisely is more than just a body. </seg>
<seg id=601> The authority must be the real head of the coordination of the network of national agencies, which, in turn, a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions on the way and coordinate must. </seg>
<seg id=602> Their amendment no 11 and my amendment no 17 should therefore perfectly to reconcile. </seg>
<seg id=603> The reform of the food legislation in the European Union should, at the level of the European Union level. </seg>
<seg id=604> In his report to be not so much amendments tabled, as priorities. </seg>
<seg id=605> In the report we have this demand clearly formulated, which I very much welcome. </seg>
<seg id=606> The creation of a European food safety authority, however, is extremely positive. </seg>
<seg id=607> In the interests of all the citizens of the Union is to be hoped that these criteria will also be respected. </seg>
<seg id=608> In my opinion, must be laid down specific periods within which the European Commission on any case, the justifiable cause for concern, to inform. </seg>
<seg id=609> The Eu must their citizens in the area of food highest possible standards guarantee. </seg>
<seg id=610> Now the Commission is proposing the creation of a European food authority. </seg>
<seg id=611> I am concerned that Europe once again is in danger of a to make unwieldy bureaucracy, which is unable to act. </seg>
<seg id=612> The more new bureaucratic levels we create and the more money we spend, the less does it mean. </seg>
<seg id=613> Prevent it similar and parallel work in various institutions. </seg>
<seg id=614> However, it is important to avoid that, in the shadow of the discussion on the White Paper the fear of public from a bureaucratic Europe, which on the quality of the products have any influence, without effective against the health risk deception and misleading consumers to act, will be strengthened. </seg>
<seg id=615> As you know, is the strategy for the food safety in the Commission' s top priority. </seg>
<seg id=616> The Commission will adopt a proposal for a regulation, the framework for future health protection measures in the area of food will be and by what the general principles of food law and objectives. </seg>
<seg id=617> Thank you very much, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=618> But now to our report, I see the Commission proposal as positive and have to say that the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy and the Committee on development and cooperation of Parliament have done a hard work to make it possible, and, in particular, on certain points, continue to improve. </seg>
<seg id=619> As has already been our colleague, Mrs Bonino, explicitly and clearly mentioned, was with the proposal for a regulation of the Commission a further step forward. </seg>
<seg id=620> We think that the proposal for a regulation of the Commission is too vague. </seg>
<seg id=621> It is essential that the provision for mine clearance organised in accordance with reasonable and that we research fund for Detektions- and clearance work, for instruments in the area, which, in a simple way can be used so that it is precisely in the developing countries aid. </seg>
<seg id=622> In the past eight years, we have more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget for the fight against landmines available. </seg>
<seg id=623> We can, however, the people not for its government unfÃ¤hige punished. </seg>
<seg id=624> As I have already said, it would, in my view, although well-intentioned, but nevertheless counter-productive and wrong to the accession of the Ottawa Convention on binding and immediately to be met condition for the support of mine action by the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=625> I reject amendment no 19. </seg>
<seg id=626> Secondly, the international community must the coordination at global level and particularly in the countries concerned improve. </seg>
<seg id=627> Mr President, the Socialist group agrees with the comments made by Mr van Orden and is also proud of the role of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=628> We remember the Soviet game takes bombs in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id=629> Thank you for a good report. </seg>
<seg id=630> Mr President, the Cambodians call the mines as eternal guards. </seg>
<seg id=631> With regard to uniformed forces the people have a legitimate suspicions that in long war years has built up. </seg>
<seg id=632> Mr President, I am glad that, at last, a European legislation in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that there is us today is a very good report by Mrs Bonino on this regulation before us. </seg>
<seg id=633> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today with a very sad subject to do. </seg>
<seg id=634> It is not by chance that the mines are mainly in crisis areas, i.e. in areas where different initiatives could be taken to ensure that this to manage crises. </seg>
<seg id=635> In two kilometres away from a Bosnian village is in 1999 a sign to the mines risk in a field, which does not, however, prevent a small junge there is. </seg>
<seg id=636> It is tragic that if the civilian population under the inability suffering of its leaders must. </seg>
<seg id=637> Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our institution, with its particular country relations within the framework of our common project to build an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean has to welcome. </seg>
<seg id=638> All mines are in Depots. </seg>
<seg id=639> Mr President, since I with almost all agree, what my colleagues have said before, I do not wish to repeat it all. </seg>
<seg id=640> Your view of open cooperation is synonymous with a decline in the Commission officials dominated institutional system. </seg>
<seg id=641> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, the fact that decisions taken as close to those affected as possible to be taken. </seg>
<seg id=642> However, as the main amendments just the evp-fraktion have been able to find a substantial majority, I have voted in favour of the report. </seg>
<seg id=643> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz for two reasons included the vote: firstly, because I had the opportunity, especially on paragraphs 2 and 5 separate vote and by my opposition to two to express. </seg>
<seg id=644> In other words, the table of the common European House would some Ã  la carte Speisen, while others with the unity menu have to content. </seg>
<seg id=645> And the democratic control must not flag. However, there is, in our view, the main problem with the European Union is not on the list of these rights and its incorporation into the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=646> The instrument of the referenda and the amendments to this report have already been mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=647> In the election to the European Parliament in 1999 fraud the turnout only 40 %, if the countries with election duty and those who, at the same time as the elections carried national elections, abrechnet. </seg>
<seg id=648> In order to achieve the desired objective of a European Constitution, it is not advisable to strict right pieces to force and methods, the disastrous consequences of the desired objective the verfehlen would. </seg>
<seg id=649> A real social Constitution, the main achievements in favour of the labour market, women, immigrants and citizens upwards out to adapt. </seg>
<seg id=650> (PT) I have not voted in favour, although I it a commendable intention of strengthening, lighting and deepening of the European Union and the simplification of texts, the need for its proximity to the public is not abspreche. </seg>
<seg id=651> The division of responsibilities </seg>
<seg id=652> In my opinion, it is crucial that the Charter of fundamental rights in the Eu an end of the Convention on human rights of the Council of Europe means. </seg>
<seg id=653> The report by Mr Gil Robles me, however, is to help, because it contains the proposal that some Member States of the European Union on certain issues, sectors and areas of a common approach to harmonise. </seg>
<seg id=654> If on more and more important issues be decided by qualified majority voting, basic standards of democracy are being violated. </seg>
<seg id=655> Today it is trying to impede the flexibility of closer cooperation, and this subject to. </seg>
<seg id=656> The report before us is to the relevant position of Parliament specify (resolution of 13 April 2000). </seg>
<seg id=657> We are largely a so-called flexible cooperation in favour. </seg>
<seg id=658> The British labour members of the pse-fraktion welcome the support for your contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference to the issue of closer cooperation, even if they do not have all the details agree. </seg>
<seg id=659> These islands must as an active part of the European Union feel that they, I hope, in a paradise for tourists and for turning the local population. </seg>
<seg id=660> In the Middle ages were these regions and their populations not to Europe, and today they are not as really European. </seg>
<seg id=661> In fact, make the specific features of these regions which, in general, because of their island status and their distance from the European mainland, but also from their chronic dependence on a few products or a single product, are needed, that in order to overcome these obstacles appropriate, specific measures to be taken. </seg>
<seg id=662> Mr President, please excuse me if I the Bureau and the interpreters again so that visit, my last explanation of vote to, and I would like in particular to my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, in my case, the Italian woman ornella buson, express. </seg>
<seg id=663> From these texts is clear that this agency to the restriction or paralysis of the national protection powers, aimed at in the service of the Commission' s objectives. </seg>
<seg id=664> This is the Commission and Parliament, however, not prevent, this institution as a ' European authority ' to describe, although the name of the philosophy of the behind this institution completely contradicts. </seg>
<seg id=665> This is not exactly what the Bowis report proposes, where one has the feeling that the food safety will essentially as another pretext of view, by means of which it the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of the national institutions and the security of the citizens further would like to. </seg>
<seg id=666> Therefore I think it is appropriate, by this statement on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always been in favour of respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all religious communities has occurred, this incredible actions to be condemned. </seg>
<seg id=667> Madam President, I understand the interventions of the rapporteur, but with the amendments of the Committee on agriculture and rural development is not just voted on money, but it is also about a certain direction vote. </seg>
<seg id=668> I would also like to ask you to support here that we the budget line a 206, acquisition of property, to adjust, depending on which amendments are adopted, so that we our own limit of 20 % of total administrative expenditure is not exceed. </seg>
<seg id=669> Before the vote on amendment 929 </seg>
<seg id=670> Section vi, economic and social Committee </seg>
<seg id=671> Report by (A5-0276/2000) Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish sea (ices-gebiet vii a) (KOM(2000)0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071(CNS)) </seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=673> By the export subsidies will of the Eu life funds on shot at dumping prices on the world market, which in turn to serious for example competition for the food industry in many developing countries leads. </seg>
<seg id=674> In order to have sufficient financial resources for additional aid to release the Balkans, the Member States must the funds from the existing budget redistributed. </seg>
<seg id=675> Nevertheless, Parliament succeeded in a series of important to impose tasks - not least in terms of increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and gender equality, etc. We have against the attacks of the right to the life programme and the European women' s lobby voted in favour. </seg>
<seg id=676> What the travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament is concerned, we stick to our believe that this only for the in actual travel costs may be paid. </seg>
<seg id=677> I assume - and I hope that the Commission appropriate constructive solutions with regard - that we the three years between 2002 and 2005, with a transitional period fill. </seg>
<seg id=678> In order, above all, the national parliaments to miss a genuine muzzle the European Commission in the context of their regulatory and liberalisierungswut a proposal for a directly binding regulation rather than a directive presented in a genuine hauruckverfahren by Parliament and the Council of Ministers gepeitscht to already on 31 December of this year in to enter into force. </seg>
<seg id=679> We therefore support the reform process instigated by the Commission and reject the other favour this sector. </seg>
<seg id=680> They were in strong dependence on credit dictates. </seg>
<seg id=681> Nicholson report (A-0276/2000) </seg>
<seg id=682> The purpose of alienation of resources for military targets must be avoided. </seg>
<seg id=683> We have always taken the view that the cost of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the first instance, of the actual perpetrators, in other words the big business, to be taken and to the detriment of their super profits must go. </seg>
<seg id=684> Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0271/2000) </seg>
<seg id=685> These funds should be used by the expenditure for the research policy in all 15 Member States of the European Union harmonised and coordinated. </seg>
<seg id=686> In order to make provision, it is true that we are clear about these substances to make. </seg>
<seg id=687> That concludes voting time. </seg>
<seg id=688> It is to take the place of the now everywhere used national Formats are. </seg>
<seg id=689> The payment assessment statistical loss as a result of this amendment is minimal. </seg>
<seg id=690> You must imagine that it is, of course, primarily small and medium-sized companies are affected. </seg>
<seg id=691> We are pushing for years to a harmonisation of effort. </seg>
<seg id=692> I believe that this report is of crucial importance to really the citizens, the small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro area to integrate and the acceptance of the economic and monetary union to increase. </seg>
<seg id=693> In the free movement of capital with the single currency must not obstacles or greater differences. </seg>
<seg id=694> Nevertheless, to the European Parliament and the Commission the great attention. </seg>
<seg id=695> I support the twin-track approach of the rapporteur, with the hesitant banks wants to encourage to move. </seg>
<seg id=696> We can the banks not to force verlusttrÃ¤chtigen shops, but as politicians we can the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, you for the have tabled ppe-de-fraktion support what before the end of next year measures and best of the existence of appropriate standards of the introduction of the euro coins and Â­ Scheine be called for. </seg>
<seg id=697> The request by Mrs Peijs and I is also in the direction that the banks together at a table, not in order to make requirements, but because we are from the political side the pressure no longer able to increase. </seg>
<seg id=698> If the handling of cross-border payments as expensive remains as today, it is the credibility of the new mÃ¼nzen- and notes system called into question. </seg>
<seg id=699> In our view, this form of the collection of statistical data on the Union internal transactions a relic of the past, the in an integrated, single area no longer be justified, and the proper funktionieren of the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=700> If I the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee, which this House has already belong longer than I understand that I have the impression that the exercise with the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which is now the European Parliament as for the fourth time in this category heard. </seg>
<seg id=701> I thank you in advance for the support of my report. </seg>
<seg id=702> But if we withdraw at European level, then we have the regions renewed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=703> The kmu are first and foremost in the creation of jobs, both in terms of quality and also in quantitative terms, and to play in this way a key role for the social cohesion and regional development. </seg>
<seg id=704> By the careful study of the proposals and the vote with many interested parties it has a contribution to clearer wording of the programme and the best possible preparation done. </seg>
<seg id=705> Thirdly, we need to be added European use efforts. </seg>
<seg id=706> It follows that it is small and medium-sized enterprises only then is a good thing if unemployment is low and if the public budgets at all levels free of debt and are sufficient resources for these in the investment budget stop. </seg>
<seg id=707> Businesses need to be clear. </seg>
<seg id=708> Above all, if a a man business or a company under 250 employees, a project, it is not only with sure positions of land with a 120 % -sicherung be possible, but it should also be possible, with a good idea to be financed. </seg>
<seg id=709> The national states and the regional or local authorities are already a huge financial pumps, which are there, taxpayers ' money, that is to say by the majority of the population, including the poorest, eingetriebenen amounts in the large companies and thus in the pockets of their owners and shareholders to pump. </seg>
<seg id=710> Small and medium-sized enterprises bring thousands of tender plant out the large companies as seed for human create force and ideas serve. </seg>
<seg id=711> I would like the Commissioner in connection with all the measures proposed here primarily concerned, that a easier and quicker access to be created aid and information, so that those who these companies, are able to effectively use this information. </seg>
<seg id=712> They are all in the multiannual programme take their place. </seg>
<seg id=713> Finally, I also welcome the idea that we meet in the year to report on the implementation of the programme to draw. </seg>
<seg id=714> The recent actions against the Greek minority in areas himare more clearly, measures to democratisation, the strengthening of the institutions and the protection of human rights in Albania. </seg>
<seg id=715> A considerable number of Albanians leave their homes due to the insecurity in their country, because of the social difficulties, because of the prÃ¤modernen social and family structures. </seg>
<seg id=716> We need specifically tailored to Albania preventive measures, which help in the construction or reconstruction of the country are so as a decent standard of living in the region as possible. </seg>
<seg id=717> The documents of a body to other put, and the European Commission is refusing, for example, the report, including the customs drawn up by the Albanians assistance mission (cam), to be published. </seg>
<seg id=718> Let us look the truth in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id=719> Mrs Karamanou, my congratulations to the broad and comprehensive tour Ã¯horizon of her report. </seg>
<seg id=720> This is an extremely important issue of which, for historical, social, political and economic situation arises. </seg>
<seg id=721> The real number of deaths we will never know. </seg>
<seg id=722> Common business create peaceful ties. </seg>
<seg id=723> What I, however, completely unacceptable to find this report and which I open would like to point out is that cause and effect, that is illegal immigration with a method of reimbursement visas and therefore the migration possibility be confused. It is exactly the opposite! </seg>
<seg id=724> From the Treaty of Amsterdam secondary major institutional reforms have effects on the treatment of problems of refugee and immigration policy. </seg>
<seg id=725> Thirdly and finally, the action plan and its implementation regional be considered. </seg>
<seg id=726> But, of course, this is also invitation to us, careful with European regulations to deal. </seg>
<seg id=727> This strength of the Community action must just now be highlighted. </seg>
<seg id=728> Furthermore, I would argue that, in changes to the existing legislation codified eg proposals will be presented in the changes to the existing directives or regulations incorporated. </seg>
<seg id=729> The principle of subsidiarity, understood correctly, has us in both directions: to take decisions at the lowest level, but to recognise that the level niedrigstmÃ¶gliche sometimes a very high level can be, if it is a question of universal values, the loss threatens, if it is not always equally protected would. </seg>
<seg id=730> The report is a typical example of concise, clear wording, and I hope colleagues will also with very serious note. </seg>
<seg id=731> The report by the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market was in its members not to enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id=732> I am point in the report on the slim-vorhaben made, because the Community legislation Mr Medina has us with the verlesen one of the articles of the Treaty just a test there are even for specialists difficult to understand. </seg>
<seg id=733> Therefore solve some aspects of the report in me little enthusiasm for, because I would have liked to see a more ' vergemeinschaftenden ' report in relation to the internal market wanted, and it is clear that the report of it is not imbued. </seg>
<seg id=734> For the eu-institutionen it is important that we have a strong commitment to the quality of legislation, especially in view of the principle of subsidiarity, to improve. </seg>
<seg id=735> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=736> The continuing existence of this situation could the recruitment and the acceptance of citizens with regard to the euro negative impact. </seg>
<seg id=737> Mr President, we have with very great care in the Committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights, justice and home Affairs, the Karamanou report prepared. </seg>
<seg id=738> However, as chairman of the Committee on fisheries, I would like to our oral question and take advantage of this debate to make two sides - because our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides, a few comments to present, and I would like to this with great bedacht do. </seg>
<seg id=739> This is the demand of the people of the Union, whom we represent here. </seg>
<seg id=740> A great deal of water is the Rhine gone down, the agreement has expired however, and has not been replaced. </seg>
<seg id=741> I can understand the reasons of the Commissioner, but not the of the Director-General. </seg>
<seg id=742> We could say that we 11 months after the closure of our vessels continue to figures the previous agreement and for the previous of the previous. </seg>
<seg id=743> Mr President, a similar debate we had a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations have only just begun, shows how difficult it is to fish stocks for our extensive eu-flotten to find. </seg>
<seg id=744> The second agreement was the position clear. </seg>
<seg id=745> But we must realise that everything is finally, the fisheries resources. </seg>
<seg id=746> That is why I am especially keen to make it clear that the group of the evp-ed not only has prominent, to support the fisheries agreements, to defend and promote, but also to extend its determination to promote. </seg>
<seg id=747> Thirdly, the exploitation of the fishing land the Sahara since the suspension of the fisheries agreement by fleets of the Community and other continue been of no of control by the Commission or by the Member States: it is, above all, by a large fleet from the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id=748> I understand that since the fisheries was a source and creating jobs for a, in terms of European conditions, poor region. </seg>
<seg id=749> Another aspect I would like to emphasise is the expiry of the transitional aid to fishermen and vessel owners of the end of the month, which as compensation for this year are standstill. This situation is intolerable, because everyone wants to but work rather than aid policy. </seg>
<seg id=750> I as a parliamentarian andalusischer am for a year in the process of in the corridors, in the offices, in the Committee on fisheries and in the discussions with the Commissioner to negotiate and to propose initiatives, so that the special nature of the Andalusian fleet to be taken into account in the Morocco fisheries operation carried out. </seg>
<seg id=751> Spain has the difficult neighbours in the history always between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco has been in an excellent way developed in a positive way. </seg>
<seg id=752> As a Spanish and andalusischer Member I call on the right of thousands of andalusischer and Spanish families to preserve and protect their jobs for almost a year are at risk and that we in this House must protect. </seg>
<seg id=753> We shall now proceed to the vote. </seg>
<seg id=754> Almost twelve services comfort full of history, delaying tactics, hopes, even personal suffering, in order placebos for the people concerned, to the tough defence of citizens with regard to old rights, the nothing else who came as a right. </seg>
<seg id=755> As you know, the matter is extremely complex and concerns approximately 700 employees to 25 Italian universities. </seg>
<seg id=756> If the Italian legal system will be reformed and changed, as for the hochschulpersonal was the case, the Commission can we do not believe Eingreifen, while each European citizens have the same access to all categories has. </seg>
<seg id=757> The injustice lies in the fact that two people do the same work, side by side work, but be paid different and different working conditions. </seg>
<seg id=758> Worst of all, it is, I think that if we draw attention to the fact is that a judgment in their favour may only for a few reassuring words, and for its continuing life not really is important. </seg>
<seg id=759> I expect a response from the Commission to the point that it in accordance with the decision of the Court of justice in the case against alluÃ© Article 48 (2) of the contrary ewg-vertrags if in the legislation of a Member State the duration of contracts of foreign language assistants each is limited to one year, with the option of extending, while in relation to other teachers such a limit, in principle, there is no. </seg>
<seg id=760> Now, in my opinion, deal with these matters to the very heart of the fundamental associated with the European right principles of freedom, particularly the freedom of movement, and of these principles, there can be no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id=761> We have, as today' s debate shows that a great many constraints, very many obstacles to the internal market, not only in this case. </seg>
<seg id=762> We shall now proceed to the vote. </seg>
<seg id=763> (the President cut the speaker off) </seg>
<seg id=764> In Kondolenzschreiben to the Austrian federal President Klestil and to Chancellor SchÃ¼ssel, I have on behalf of the House to the victims ' families and the whole of the Austrian people at this difficult time our sympathy expressed. </seg>
<seg id=765> Are there any comments? </seg>
<seg id=766> I support the proposal by Mr Ceyhun and would be very grateful if the Council could say whether it intends, in fact, a new proposal on this matter to make. </seg>
<seg id=767> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group believes that this event is so important that we believe that it is not as a matter of urgency treated properly. </seg>
<seg id=768> Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I have the impression that you, if I have understood correctly, this explanatory statement support. </seg>
<seg id=769> Madam President, some time ago we debated in this House on the sanctions against Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=770> It is essential that we still implementation of the amendments by the British authorities in this respect to hold a debate, and the Commission has clearly the legal provisions in this matter. </seg>
<seg id=771> (A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights, justice and home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the conclusion of a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the field of the fight against organised crime, the Waschens the proceeds of crime and the financial crime (10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815(CNS)). </seg>
<seg id=772> The consequences of intent must concrete steps to ensure that the proceeds of crime identified frozen, seized and confiscated. </seg>
<seg id=773> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice must not in the hands of a specialised body under the sole control of the national governments remain. </seg>
<seg id=774> On the other hand, limited Article 8 of the draft Convention the reasons for the refusal to grant legal assistance, on the one Member State ersuchter can professions, on the essential interests. </seg>
<seg id=775> I would like to begin by Mr Marinho on his work and to point out that, in the efforts to support the fight against crime, but also caution. </seg>
<seg id=776> If terrorists and arms dealers or engage in money laundering, it must of course identified, pursued and punished. </seg>
<seg id=777> It is our task to the proceeds from organised crime out, to identify, freeze, seize and to be. </seg>
<seg id=778> It is on these points in the amendments and, following the debate in the Committee to judge, I am very confident that Parliament votes in favour of. </seg>
<seg id=779> It seems to me that this catalogue of initiatives in a direction which, in Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms laid down protection may ruin. </seg>
<seg id=780> In reality, however, things are not as simple as that. </seg>
<seg id=781> Finally, the evp-fraktion supports the compromise amendment on the activities of lawyers, on which we have reached Mrs Roure. </seg>
<seg id=782> The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonisation. </seg>
<seg id=783> This is a Portuguese initiative, to which several speakers have expressed appreciation. </seg>
<seg id=784> And that was also the aim of the joint meeting of the justice and home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council on 17 October this year. </seg>
<seg id=785> The best way for a strengthening of parliamentary and judicial control over Europol is the full involvement of the Europol on income in the framework of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=786> A step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has been seeking for a long time, is the creation of a provisional unit judicial cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=787> That is the purpose of the guarantees, namely in the development of this aspect of the freedoms. </seg>
<seg id=788> And the European Parliament is the supranational Community body, which establishes these relations. In my contribution I would like to ask you, on the basis of this to show our relations and our rapporteur for their support. </seg>
<seg id=789> Only when clarity on the institutional model and the rules for the future is European judicial area, will the citizens and the European Parliament on the proposed by the Council comment on individual measures. </seg>
<seg id=790> That is why EUR just a logical part of the efforts, the citizens by the fight against serious organised crime an area of freedom, security and justice, as well as a high degree of safety to offer. </seg>
<seg id=791> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can the Mrs Gebhardt only congratulate on her excellent report, in implementation of the Council decision taken in Tampere to present. </seg>
<seg id=792> It is, however, as in euro precisely of coordination at the level of the national public prosecutors and judges, in order to all forms of serious to combat crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, then, is the enlargement of the concept: it is not just a question of cooperation in purely cross-border crime, but it is a question of cooperation to combat criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id=793> We are already from 1 January 2001 have an opportunity in this provisional unit to commit judicial cooperation. But the Commission intends to the debate on the design of the euro just point definitive recovery. </seg>
<seg id=794> It was from all sides honest position - I believe - without, however, in too rigid front positions lapse. </seg>
<seg id=795> The problems in connection with the expenditure were for the Committee on fisheries the not too alarming; other areas are of greater interest. </seg>
<seg id=796> It is really unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives and the results are not able to judge. That there is in any other institution. </seg>
<seg id=797> Second point: in the area of the hierarchy of the instructions power it is here to actually come unacceptable interference, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=798> I would like to make it clear that the programme on some issues has played a positive role. </seg>
<seg id=799> It is obvious that this work within consortia not automatically to duality in terms of the common leads financial responsibility. The problem is more complex. </seg>
<seg id=800> We have really in favour of this 3.4 million back, and we can say that we are the more than 90 % succeeded. </seg>
<seg id=801> Are there any comments? </seg>
<seg id=802> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after neunmonatiger work and a long-standing struggle for a consensus is the Charter of European fundamental rights in the draft. </seg>
<seg id=803> I hope that this Parliament, even if it is only now, of course, to say to the Charter of fundamental rights, in the next few weeks no doubt about it is that the Council the legally binding nature of the Charter required and that this Charter the people access to the European Court of justice open must. </seg>
<seg id=804> This position is true, as we know, with the Heads of State and government at the European Council in Biarritz the view that the Charter have approved unanimously and unreservedly. I can therefore, on behalf of the only ask Council to follow this position by I have a number of reasons explain. </seg>
<seg id=805> But above all, the Charter I am convinced by its content weight a - I would say - epochale importance. </seg>
<seg id=806> The European trade Union Confederation, for its part, has on the - as it is called - existence of gaps complained, as, for example, the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id=807> Irrespective of have a number of people, and, in particular, some members of the European Parliament proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of fundamental rights in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which has been a reference to the European Convention on human rights contains. </seg>
<seg id=808> Our group agrees with the exception of the British delegation of the Charter unanimously. </seg>
<seg id=809> We are in the European people' s Party jointly and unanimously to ensure that the Charter of fundamental rights as soon as possible will be included in the Treaties, so that they direct legal force for the people in the European Union developed. </seg>
<seg id=810> They have shown us that we the European issues on a new and exemplary way can approach on the basis of their democratic, open and transparent way of working and the possibility of their participation in the form of the Intergovernmental Conference consider. </seg>
<seg id=811> The right to health, to security, to housing or to a lack of income in full or in the field of solidarity referred. </seg>
<seg id=812> Fourthly, the Charter - and this seems to me to be particularly important - is the indivisibility of civil and political human rights and social rights. </seg>
<seg id=813> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, values, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, this Charter merely the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union, repeatedly importance empty texts and declarations of intent to produce. </seg>
<seg id=814> The representative of the Court of justice has already indicated that one of the Charter inspiration, and the representatives of the Commission in the Convention in Turin attaches the document legal importance to. </seg>
<seg id=815> After the time of the market that is perhaps at last the time of the Europe of rights come. The concept of citizenship in the European Union, is a fairly new concept. </seg>
<seg id=816> The Charter is indeed worded as a text, which are legally binding. </seg>
<seg id=817> With pride I can also see that a representative of my group in my own country, Mr Gunnar jansson, a very important role in the drafting of the Charter has played. </seg>
<seg id=818> As I said last night, and I do so again today, there are in this respect throughout the Union still too many shortcomings. So we succeed in our efforts to judicial and police cooperation is not always, certain effects eliminate the fight against crime and to prevent innocent to help passive victims. </seg>
<seg id=819> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of fundamental rights is based on the same uncertainty as the work of the body. </seg>
<seg id=820> The Italian Constitution, for example, the border of the Sittlichkeit, and the Convention on human rights the border of the rights of others and the public order. </seg>
<seg id=821> Mr President, in today' s vote at 12 noon, we support a process, the 1984 began in this Parliament the draft of the Treaty on European Union adopted, which have already been called for a declaration of the rights and the 1989 with the resolution de Gucht has been followed. </seg>
<seg id=822> The Charter will have consequences, whether they be enshrined in the Treaty or not. </seg>
<seg id=823> This is to be welcomed, and not, as Mr Bonde seems to think that to fear. </seg>
<seg id=824> Clearly this is neigende century, with all its fight for the liberation of disadvantaged social classes, useless passed and has nothing taught. </seg>
<seg id=825> The Charter fills a gap in the eg-recht and strengthen the protection of individuals with regard to the European police, to the authorities, the fight against fraud, and the competition authorities. </seg>
<seg id=826> However, the rejection by the shortcomings of the Charter is justified, I cannot understand. </seg>
<seg id=827> Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton has left off. </seg>
<seg id=828> Allow me a third comment on the rights of third country nationals. </seg>
<seg id=829> The Council of Europe has in addition to the Court of human rights are a great deal of experience with such forms of monitoring collected on which we can build. </seg>
<seg id=830> In view of the text of the Charter, which we today give our assent, as I hope, by a large majority -, it is clear that we with our Charter more and achieve a zeitgemÃ¤Ãeren protection of fundamental rights, as it accession to the European Convention on human rights provided would. </seg>
<seg id=831> That is why it is important to make progress. </seg>
<seg id=832> I believe that we must pursue this objective if we the necessary support for the Charter by the citizens of Europe want to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=833> After its adoption by this Parliament will the Charter of fundamental rights me as analysis system used for this report, and as far as my personal intellectual potential and the I available human resources, it will allow me, I will a after rights and countries untergliederte analysis of compliance with the Charter in the fifteen Member States of the Union to make. </seg>
<seg id=834> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to begin by the words of President Moscovici in the substantial contribution of the members of the European Parliament on the debate in the Convention pay tribute, in particular the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo, he in the Praesidium of the Convention played in the drafting of the Charter of fundamental rights. </seg>
<seg id=835> I would just like to respond to some of the points markantesten this debate. </seg>
<seg id=836> The Convention has fundamental rights from the various legal instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=837> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports: </seg>
<seg id=838> At this stage Parliament has also the Turkish people to make it clear that it is at least three conditions for its accession. </seg>
<seg id=839> Such conditions would also not only by Parliament' sdecision can be made. </seg>
<seg id=840> I therefore made by Mr Morillon suggestions on the conditions for the accession of Turkey taken note of the great interest deserve. </seg>
<seg id=841> I am happy to say that the Turkish government in the meantime, this accession partnership as a basis for further cooperation has recognised, so that we can have hoped, just to achieve what we wanted to achieve with our policy the reformers in Turkey, to help the reform process to give new impetus and it in relation to the objective of membership of the European Union forward. </seg>
<seg id=842> In my view it is most important is that, in Helsinki in Turkey, in the Turkish public a debate on the conditions of accession of Turkey to the Eu caused has been a debate that the forces of reform of the country supports and calls for. </seg>
<seg id=843> This text is the opinion before you. </seg>
<seg id=844> It is now a question of a necessary boost for future accession. </seg>
<seg id=845> I would, however, I do not know how the vote turns out, Turkey urge that this question should be taken seriously. </seg>
<seg id=846> The European Parliament will play an active role for the reception and care of relations with the political parties, the nro and use of the press and is trying to improve their difficult and sometimes tense relationship to the national Assembly. </seg>
<seg id=847> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my opinion, very realistically and responsibly. </seg>
<seg id=848> On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March you have the problem of the Kurdish people, just today, at least with names. </seg>
<seg id=849> It is also of great frankness and great arrogance, accept that Europeans the Turks to a - and I quote - ' radical change in their habits and mentality ' could move. </seg>
<seg id=850> Mr President, values, ladies and gentlemen, this report fills me with great concern. </seg>
<seg id=851> Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233(AVC)) </seg>
<seg id=852> In any case, we must look at the next occasions when we have to discuss the power of the data processing, be aware that a thorough and, hence, the citizens more legally certain control is required. </seg>
<seg id=853> Recommendation Duff/Voggenhuber (A5-0325/2000) </seg>
<seg id=854> The following points we would like to highlight: </seg>
<seg id=855> The rights contained in the Charter are already in the national constitutions rooted and be defended by the national parliaments, the peoples and their cultures are close to. </seg>
<seg id=856> 1, which states: ' collective expulsions are not allowed ', does not stipulate that this ban in times of war or in cases of serious problems can be exposed to public order. In Article 52 ( </seg>
<seg id=857> We are following a brief explanation of these three reasons, in that order. </seg>
<seg id=858> The right of a government to the arbitrary removal of their own constitution is characteristic of a tyranny. </seg>
<seg id=859> Today, however, we have, I repeat, every reason, proud to be, as we this important stage for Europe have carried out. </seg>
<seg id=860> A society which only knows rights, but no duties will be a selfish society. </seg>
<seg id=861> Our is intended primarily to fight to ensure that the fundamental rights proclaimed on the political choices to be made more concrete. </seg>
<seg id=862> The process of the Convention is very interesting and efficient for the drafting of a basis text, which requires a broad consensus, but it can in no way justify the European Parliament, as the representative of the European peoples the possibility of amending and supplementing the text to avoid. </seg>
<seg id=863> This Charter must be improved, and Parliament must a strategy to updating and enriching propose. </seg>
<seg id=864> It should, therefore, at the Council meeting in Nice not be decided and proclaimed but of the summit should the impetus for a European debate on the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=865> Fortunately, in the national governments vorzuherrschen the tendency to follow the path of reason, that is, a charter with a purely political and not binding scope to adopt. </seg>
<seg id=866> The Cologne Summit as ' body ', has this itself the ' convention ' proclaimed, a term that in a fatal to in 1793 and the another Convention verantwortenden excesses of the French revolution in the form of terrorism reminded. </seg>
<seg id=867> The procedure followed, which made exclusion and the lack of clarity regarding the nature of this text, however, throw a clear light on the new totalitarian approaches, which has already in the heart of the European integration process are available. </seg>
<seg id=868> Fortunately, the European Parliament in this area until the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam only a consultative role, but there is a way, this use of that right decisions to be delayed. </seg>
<seg id=869> The views on the way but differ. </seg>
<seg id=870> That was a century ago as and when it somewhat pushed into the background was, it is now again fully brought to the fore. </seg>
<seg id=871> What we do not want to case, which are opportunities which allow criminals, by the back door to the single market. </seg>
<seg id=872> We also support the creation of a future cooperation point to support the fight against organised crime and money-laundering and the various measures proposed in order to achieve these objectives. </seg>
<seg id=873> In other words, it is a provisional unit set up of judicial cooperation from the a representative of the public prosecutor, judge or police with pre-trial powers of our 15 Member States together. </seg>
<seg id=874> Mr President, as a member of the gemischten parliamentary committee eu-tÃ¼rkei I am very closely with the prospect of accession to Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=875> Also Turkey' s conduct in Cyprus is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id=876> However, we support the rapporteur' s critical objection on the lack of an effective evaluation of the lending by the eib and the lack of transparency and the public control of the activities of the bank. </seg>
<seg id=877> Despite their differences was, and Turkey is an integral part of the European reality. </seg>
<seg id=878> The admission of Turkey into the European Union is to become an issue which, today more topical than ever. </seg>
<seg id=879> Mr Morillon says that Turkey should make an effort, the European Union not as exclusive Christian club to look at it, Turkey, to exclude. </seg>
<seg id=880> Turkey will be a real democratic state, if they with its past life have learned, as well as the democratic Germany, which we have asked the same, has managed to with its past life. </seg>
<seg id=881> As soon as the government in Ankara has realised that the status quo for Europe and the rest of the world is not acceptable, great progress be possible. The reunited island could and a comprehensive, just and lasting and the law appropriate solution be found. </seg>
<seg id=882> Why are because all these issues in the report of the European Commission not mentioned? </seg>
<seg id=883> In this balanced framework we have our work to promote the convergence between the Union and Turkey determined to continue. </seg>
<seg id=884> If you the Armenian issue in connection with the deal with eu-beitritt - take account of ask you what I say to you: the Armenian question in connection with the eu-beitritt -, it is the project on which we have spoken today, not start, it is as simple as that. </seg>
<seg id=885> That is why we have worked so hard to ensure that after the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process will be drawn a conclusion, so that we in Marseilles, are capable of the necessary guidelines set. </seg>
<seg id=886> We have, however, managed to maintain the dialogue and also sensitive issues such as stability, terrorism, migration, human rights to raise. </seg>
<seg id=887> Irrespective of the Council has made an effort, in particular since 1995, for the Mediterranean allocate more resources to the objectives of the partnership are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id=888> This is indeed a very important matter, and I would like to this as someone say, from Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id=889> Mr President, as you know, there are in englischen a saying that a show without star as a Hamlet screening without the first deaths graves. </seg>
<seg id=890> We are talking about the combination of policies to the internal market questions and a consensus on the introduction of the cumulation of origin while conclusion of sub-regional free trade agreement between all partners and the adoption of the harmonised protocol on the cumulation of origin. </seg>
<seg id=891> We have also the Commission' s intention to give the Barcelona process new impetus, noted with satisfaction. </seg>
<seg id=892> I have highlighted these aspects because that is the key to the resumption of the process is to seek and also the political agenda Barcelona must be supplemented. </seg>
<seg id=893> Therefore, our main task the safeguarding of peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do our best we can do to ensure that this cooperation will be enforced and the promised funds on the basis of the Â­ we say - selfish generosity of the European Union are used effectively. </seg>
<seg id=894> These are important and practical questions I would like to ask, and I would like to thank Mr Brok, of this debate immediately before the relevant work of the presidency and the Commission on these issues possible. </seg>
<seg id=895> The world is now have an inexorable contrary to globalisation, and in such a scenario is an organisation in large, in the vast field of international competition the main players operating blocks necessary. </seg>
<seg id=896> It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries of the EUR 4.7 billion in the Meda I programme, which expired in 1999, barely a quarter taken up. </seg>
<seg id=897> That is why the Commission' s proposal for a new impetus positive, and we fully endorse the priorities, which the Commissioner mentioned in his speeches and here this afternoon has confirmed. </seg>
<seg id=898> This is a warning for the European Union, a much more active role to play in the Mediterranean, of our European continent historically and culturally enriching and strengthened. </seg>
<seg id=899> But what is even more serious is that at the same time, because we in this House are sometimes very different positions factual exchange, more Palestinians killed. </seg>
<seg id=900> Aid for reconstruction </seg>
<seg id=901> We should in December not, however, the resources for the implementation of this regulation contribute, then today we dreschen empty straw. </seg>
<seg id=902> But we must and we do not want to face the role it played in, close, and do so I hope that the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=903> The media in the region have often been for the responsible there tragedy; it will be needed media, which completely free to the rules in force in our democracies act. </seg>
<seg id=904> A happy man I am also because it Parliament, I believe, by persistent pressure succeeded in a state of affairs, which was not just as could be described favourable, for the better to address. </seg>
<seg id=905> Again, unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really must be avoided. </seg>
<seg id=906> We must look, however, not only in Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=907> The fact that a number of programmes of the so-called performance reserve, the ' performance reserve ', been assigned to, is regrettable. </seg>
<seg id=908> In Feira it has on the stabilisation and association process those involved countries the status of potential candidates for accession granted. </seg>
<seg id=909> I refer once again to the main objectives of the cards programme: institutional strengthening in terms of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction and regional cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=910> It was right that the European Union is on the rise to power of President Kostunica reacted positively. </seg>
<seg id=911> A first meeting took place on 6 November 00 noon. </seg>
<seg id=912> What initiative in accordance with the request of the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000 does the presidency intend to take in order to play a more active role, so that the full and rest loose ensure implementation of a peace plan? </seg>
<seg id=913> How can this recovery without the settlement of this conflict be? </seg>
<seg id=914> To this end, I can only say that France and Germany - and I am not now speaking as President-in-Office of the Council, these issues on a bilateral summit last week in vittel mentioned and the establishment of a working group for the solution to this problem have decided. </seg>
<seg id=915> At the same time, given the Union these two countries continue to substantial aid through its various programmes, particularly Tacis. </seg>
<seg id=916> The presidency would like to the question by the honourable Member take the opportunity, ambiguities to eliminate. </seg>
<seg id=917> Let me the precision add that the concerns of both texts, it is the criminal framework for the fight against organised gangs of traffickers to strengthen. </seg>
<seg id=918> In the report that the Turkish Council of Ministers on 21 September of this year has passed as reform programme, in which the amendments section contains several projects: inclusion of measures to strengthen the effective equality between men and women in the social educational area in the civil code; greater fight against violence within the family; better condemnation of this violence by setting up special families judges and ban on the possibility of a strafnachlasses in crime for reasons of Ehrverletzung. </seg>
<seg id=919> The Presidency has therefore on this no answer. </seg>
<seg id=920> Next week in France on my invitation to be held a meeting of the European Conference, in other words with the candidate countries. </seg>
<seg id=921> Do you believe that the model Austria, namely bilateral majority decisions in the future will be an instrument to over the European institutions to take decisions and is a new institution or a new group to reasons, to the unanimity in the Council be able to deal? </seg>
<seg id=922> The Council has not with this letter addressed, but the Presidency has, of course, Mr Cem replied. The wording of this answer all the Member States has been sent. </seg>
<seg id=923> And what does it in the rest of the statement by Mr Cem, it has the President-in-Office, Mr Moscovici, not replied,, in his opinion, could the Cyprus issue in the further consideration of the accession partnership between Turkey and the European Union are not taken into account? </seg>
<seg id=924> We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco far more than a simple agreement on fishing and that, if this agreement does not come about, as he knows, a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco to the House might be. </seg>
<seg id=925> I must therefore my scepticism express what the outcome. </seg>
<seg id=926> With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of individual rights should be made possible. </seg>
<seg id=927> The supplementary questions must be asked by other Members. </seg>
<seg id=928> In addition, the Commission has in the on 4 October 2000 communication adopted on the European Union' s oil supply that the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources will present, which will contribute to the efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport, to strengthen. </seg>
<seg id=929> In this spirit, we have on the occasion of the vote on the resolution on the embargo within the framework of the third Committee of the general Assembly of the United Nations on 9 November an appeal to the Cuban authorities, addressed fully with the international human rights organisations to work together. </seg>
<seg id=930> It is therefore up to the NATO, to take the steps that she deems necessary to ensure such incidents will not be repeated. </seg>
<seg id=931> (the sitting was suspended at 18.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=932> If we are money, it is the privilege of the person who is the money, the political objectives, to clearly defined, and the Commissioner that has repeatedly done. </seg>
<seg id=933> His visit to be able to send out a signal and the whole of the policy we are pursuing a perspective give. </seg>
<seg id=934> If we in it a region see in the political conflicts are quite possible, we are in error. </seg>
<seg id=935> And the second requirement, which made the two rapporteurs and all of us must be supported, is the regular information and consultation of the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=936> The government also underlined the determination of the Union to this process by means of technical and economic assistance to strengthen. </seg>
<seg id=937> It was Parliament that the Commission' sproposal to establish a European Agency for reconstruction has supported. </seg>
<seg id=938> As the House knows, we believe that an appropriate explicit reference in the regulation is not necessary. </seg>
<seg id=939> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. </seg>
<seg id=940> For cooperation Asia Europe 2000 the participants agreed an enlarged and updated framework of the work programme for the coming decade is. </seg>
<seg id=941> I think that we in Europe remind you of the importance that we for Asia, and not only in terms of economic and trade. If the same at this point should be pointed out that the Asia its economic recovery, for example, of the situation, thanks to the fact that we have kept our word and our markets in the last two years open Asian exports were. </seg>
<seg id=942> I believe that was a very good political commitment, but since we still have a few problems. </seg>
<seg id=943> As you know, the Commission is asem very seriously, and we support the Commission in this regard also fully. </seg>
<seg id=944> It is necessary, the existing mechanisms for implementing to improve Community legislation, in order to increase legal certainty and the current slow pace to overcome. </seg>
<seg id=945> It should therefore the creation of new promote regional organisations and this to begin where we already have a presence of the Community, as in the western and southern Pacific. </seg>
<seg id=946> This is a prerequisite for a truly sustainable fishing. </seg>
<seg id=947> I believe that the future of fishing in international waters depends of these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, there are still far too low. At the attitude of the un, both in the Convention from 1982 and in the mentioned here in new York, to defend, we must have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing have. </seg>
<seg id=948> That is why I also believe that the Commission is a particularly important role to play. It should the fishermen to call on cooperation and propose solutions which we could all agree. </seg>
<seg id=949> Furthermore, the Commission has a lot of work in connection with negotiations to take within the framework of regional fisheries organisations must be conducted. </seg>
<seg id=950> Mr President, I have the same problem as Mr Nicholson, only much more acute. </seg>
<seg id=951> So that is the solutions proposed by the Committee on agriculture. </seg>
<seg id=952> Sometimes we have already asked whether the cyclical (crisis even perhaps by speculation triggered of these corporate structures, in this way, the monitoring of the sector according to their interests ensure. </seg>
<seg id=953> The additional eu-beihilfe in the Garot report, it is proposed that I think it is unreasonable at a time when with agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement with central and eastern Europe, the reform of agricultural policy is on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id=954> I consider it quite a sterling piece of here if, the rapporteur has, which shows what you can make administration, if a certain goals, and the is clearly set out. </seg>
<seg id=955> On the one hand, would be the largest producers or those who are integrated with downstream betrieben, far from this instrument, and the systems prefer, on which you have already: individual sparen, bank loans, compensation pay. </seg>
<seg id=956> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say from the outset that I in principle the Commission proposal to set up a compensation fund, in the interests of the Austrian agriculture welcome. </seg>
<seg id=957> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report. </seg>
<seg id=958> The following reports we want a market organisation for animal husbandry and a reduction of agricultural policy, if they soil dependent, soil dependent production. </seg>
<seg id=959> The pigs market order there are, and we should not make the mistake of, the existing pigs market order, in principle works, in question. </seg>
<seg id=960> The Commission believes that it is justified only the farmers, the to join the compensation fund, also subject to a discipline, because this Kriegen, of course, in a certain income support, whilst others, which do not join this income support not get. </seg>
<seg id=961> (the sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=962> The revenue based on the VAT make 36 % and the traditional own resources 15 % of the entire amount. </seg>
<seg id=963> Another part of the reform, which to a large extent a priority, as highlighted by the Court responds area concerns the increased importance of ergebnis- and success of measurement within a system of resource allocation under vorgegebener priorities and clearly defined, quantifiable objectives. </seg>
<seg id=964> That is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, to the members of the Court of Auditors and also in the services of the Court of Auditors to thank you very much that, in her report, the reform of the Commission support. </seg>
<seg id=965> Now I very much hope that this proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice not simply buried or swept under the carpet, but that it is this very seriously consider. </seg>
<seg id=966> The reality of the situation, as described in the annual report is rather sobering. </seg>
<seg id=967> The number of errors that have arisen is too high, as such a guarantee adopted could be. </seg>
<seg id=968> The amount for building and deeply work been about 240 million too low. </seg>
<seg id=969> I would have the Court of Auditors ' report a little more user-friendly present, supplemented by clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter. </seg>
<seg id=970> 1995 was a convention on the protection of the financial interests of the communities decided. </seg>
<seg id=971> The Commission and the Member States it should be seen the light of this, and the results of the report as a tool to improve the management of the financial resources of the European Union use. </seg>
<seg id=972> I am aware that this report and the work of Parliament in the context of the forthcoming discharge procedure to greater vigilance with regard to the expenditure will help. </seg>
<seg id=973> And now, Madam President, I would like to silence and waiting for someone from the Council to come. </seg>
<seg id=974> The Court has, as in the past few years, no precise details about made where the now have described mistake. </seg>
<seg id=975> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union is before, and the report of the Court of Auditors shows that, in the candidate countries, there is still a lot to do. </seg>
<seg id=976> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently an agreement with the Court of Auditors made on the question of whether we already in favour of the secret kÃ¤mmerchen Vorinformationen can receive from the Hofbericht, and we also agreed that we are silent about preserved. </seg>
<seg id=977> I would also like to address the Council and the question why the decision on Article 24 of the financial regulation is still awaited. </seg>
<seg id=978> Perhaps it is a bit of common sense from the European Union help resolve the problem and George Bush its rightful place in the history give, namely the waste basket. </seg>
<seg id=979> It is not our task to scapegoats to identify, either in our institutions, even in our countries. </seg>
<seg id=980> (EN) I am pleased that the Members of Parliament are of the opinion that the situation with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report in Parliament and in the Committee on budgetary control was satisfactory than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id=981> But we will have the opportunity, on all points. </seg>
<seg id=982> If it from the point of view of the auditor is relevant, we call all the facts, which are mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=983> Ladies and gentlemen, as you have said, would have been the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors by a fatal virus affected in his contribution and this high House have crept in. </seg>
<seg id=984> A number of amendments, such as Nos 1 and 6 are issues in connection, especially Britain concern, and it must be pointed out that all the representatives of the United Kingdom, from the group of the Party of European Socialists, the European people' s Party and the Greens, you with strongly defended, and they have been in the Committee on the environment adopted. </seg>
<seg id=985> Mr President, we have in March of this year, the directive on passenger cableway installations adopted. </seg>
<seg id=986> We are of the opinion that, in these cases the trade not with the burden producers obligations of the product safety law must be. </seg>
<seg id=987> We have the justification for these amendments and for the resumption of the arguments heard the industry in the Committee have been made. </seg>
<seg id=988> It should be enough if the vendor the buyer general information on the products can be and this to the lack of information and documents out. </seg>
<seg id=989> Finally, small a request to the European Commission to Article 4 on the European standards and the question of whether this must be made public. </seg>
<seg id=990> For sale be directions of charitable and non-profit-making bodies existing derogations and exemptions for in markets or from the boot second-hand goods sold I welcome. </seg>
<seg id=991> The reliability of the product safety and of service increase the value of the European label in a particularly difficult and significant moment. </seg>
<seg id=992> If we elsewhere call on the Commission, in the near future, a proposal on the safety of services to present, there is no reason why we the aspects of the services here with rules should and will, instead of waiting for the Commission' s proposal. Because it is already that demarcation difficulties arise between the various regulations and that the legal uncertainty increase in the course of time. </seg>
<seg id=993> I would like to the priorities of this proposal briefly explain. </seg>
<seg id=994> We allow now the opening the system to third countries, in particular for the candidate countries: we have the procedures for the implementation of simplified emergency measures at Community level, so that we after the recommendation immediately a regulatory committee can be actively involved. </seg>
<seg id=995> By this new provision will those shops no significant extra responsibilities imposed. </seg>
<seg id=996> The proposal in amendment no 11, the term ' producer ' by ' service providers ' to replace would not create clarity, but rather confusion, because the directive does not definition of the concept " service providers " contains. </seg>
<seg id=997> The Commission is in favour of the speedy establishment of such a network, but this has still coordinated between Member States. </seg>
<seg id=998> Such a certification can as be used as evidence, however, it does not 100 % safety. </seg>
<seg id=999> I now have explained in detail, which is why the Commission cannot accept amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 and 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and part of amendment no 7, and the second part of amendment no 21 and the first part of amendment no 27 and 34 rejects. However, the Commission accepts amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and part of amendment no 7, the first part of amendment no 21 and the second part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, since the proposal of the Commission will be improved by the amendments and greater clarity receives. </seg>
<seg id=1000> Obviously we must, in the view of Mr Crespo and Italian Socialist not of the Socialist group members. </seg>
<seg id=1001> In my opinion, there is between amendment no 12 and amendment no 37 contradiction. </seg>
<seg id=1002> With regard to the order in which I shall leave the decision to the President, but I would remind you that I in any case against all three amendments am. </seg>
<seg id=1003> The not the members of Eu Mediterranean countries in relation to the economic development of course particularly serious problems. As a result of the regional inequalities are constantly tensions. </seg>
<seg id=1004> What respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, must in the sense of a harmonised European immigration policy, as well as appropriate legal instruments for ensuring fair treatment of these immigrants instruments for financial support all those young people will be established, which, according to the Absolvierung of in-house or Hochschulstudiums in the European countries want to return to their country of origin in order to a career include. </seg>
<seg id=1005> I would like to emphasise a factor for I really decisive in this matter, that is, the lack of equality in the labour market. </seg>
<seg id=1006> (PT) Late, however, the Commission has now the programme to support the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women (2001 Â­ 2005) tabled, which is of previous programmes and, above all, by the end of this year expiring striking fourth framework programme different. </seg>
<seg id=1007> On the one hand, there have been a number of proposals to take account of my group. On the other studies have been called for, on the situation of women in the national labour markets and the lack of access to address the insurance systems, which we statistics with statement able, sexes stand need data. </seg>
<seg id=1008> (EN) My party has serious reservations about the application of Community law on the sale of consumer goods instead of the application of the concept of the mutual recognition of standards. </seg>
<seg id=1009> Now we understand it, and the amendments tabled by labour offer the guarantee that the charities shops remain intact and are exempt from the directive. </seg>
<seg id=1010> Amendment no 15, finally, is the Commission a free hand in the language regime in the Agency, which, in our view, a very worrying development. </seg>
<seg id=1011> The simplification of the decision-making process, the establishment of decentralised operational centres (not only in Pristina, what its separation of Yugoslavia would be) and the solution to the problem of dual structure with management board and may be positive steps towards the restoration of the huge administrative shortcomings within the European Agency for reconstruction to be. </seg>
<seg id=1012> We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and the parliamentary report. </seg>
<seg id=1013> Adapting the existing Community legislation in this area can, therefore, as a right to be considered. </seg>
<seg id=1014> The fund also offers the possibility that, in the form of cofinancing by the Member States more or less hidden state aid to be granted. </seg>
<seg id=1015> (EL) Despite its serious shortcomings of the Morillon report is clearly further than the Commission' s proposal on the accession partnership between the European Union and Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=1016> On the other hand, we have voted against it. </seg>
<seg id=1017> We must like the rapporteur, acknowledge that Turkey in a number of areas, progress has been made and that positive signals has been made. </seg>
<seg id=1018> Our Parliament has already since 1987 for used this recognition, and the adoption of this amendment is proof of the coherence of Parliament on this issue. </seg>
<seg id=1019> The Union must more concrete proposals and the enlargement to include Turkey as an essential geopolitical policy decisions. </seg>
<seg id=1020> Such ulterior motives are Europe and Turkey not worthy of. </seg>
<seg id=1021> For several years now, I, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada the functioning of the regional organisations, the nafo (to the North-West Atlantic fisheries organisation), see to the countries of the region, including Canada, are, and all those who in this region use traditional fishing areas, such as France, Spain and some other European countries. </seg>
<seg id=1022> It is only be satisfied when their own arms boat fleet under the stars circle banner of their fisheries policy will prevail. </seg>
<seg id=1023> The most important thing, therefore, is not to respond to the hegemony of the Commission, by it weakens the European position, which was a perfectly proper implementation of the principle of subsidiarity would contradict. </seg>
<seg id=1024> Ultimately, following tough negotiations reached a final result, the defended deserves. </seg>
<seg id=1025> With this proposal to replace of three directives on waste incineration seeks, therefore, to the quality of air, water, soil and to improve the public health by reducing emissions of rubbish particles in connection with the incineration and coincineration and, in particular, the emission of dioxins, Furanen and heavy metals reduced. </seg>
<seg id=1026> I believe it is also important to highlight the innovation that is no longer just emissions into the atmosphere, but also into the water and in the soil is mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=1027> During the discussion of the proposal is rectified. </seg>
<seg id=1028> Also the introduction of much stricter in new stickoxidgrenzwerte co-incineration, such as cement kilns, is a step forward, which is an incentive to reduce emissions, even if the proposed standards not just the latest state of the art reflect. </seg>
<seg id=1029> Ladies and gentlemen, apologise particularly you, Mr Blokland, that I for a few minutes late have. </seg>
<seg id=1030> Finally, I would like to say that this directive is an important contribution to the reduction of the negative effects on the environment, and the risks to human health. </seg>
<seg id=1031> It would be the European Parliament credit if it on behalf of the rejection of all forms of discrimination, the fight against exclusion and in accordance with the responsibility of the individual the introduction of a system would give new impetus to the practical implementation of the principle of solidarity essential possible. </seg>
<seg id=1032> From country to country are, however, major differences to see, and there is a lack of detailed and comparable statistics reliable indicate, which system where in what way is the best results, what its weaknesses there are, etc. For precisely this reason, in my on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs opinion stressed the need for the Commission prior to the adoption of any specific rules for the addition sick insurance transfers a Green Paper, in which all these dispersed data and the relevant information are identified and evaluated. </seg>
<seg id=1033> So far, this was a taboo subject to some extent. </seg>
<seg id=1034> The risk that not very healthy citizens and older people because of their high risk only partly private assure can be is for society development not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1035> The second approach, which the rapporteur explained in his introduction and that of many of my colleagues will support, involves the promotion of the necessary rules and codes of conduct on the introduction of forms of mutual cost adoption between insurers, the all the provision of high-quality services guarantee and the dangers of the development of discriminatory practices and a risk and customer choice counter. </seg>
<seg id=1036> In my opinion, it cannot be right that the money is dependent on who is on the way the top. </seg>
<seg id=1037> The new proposal of the Committee on employment and social Affairs is right, first of all, take stock in the form of a Green Paper to make, and only then to decide whether we a directive or a recommendation need. </seg>
<seg id=1038> In the Netherlands is currently on structural changes to the system discussed. </seg>
<seg id=1039> On this basis, the Commission should take the initiative and specific points as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States express. </seg>
<seg id=1040> A complete solution it is therefore for the insurance probably not be. </seg>
<seg id=1041> I therefore believe that we should Mr Rocard on his report, in which he the Commission to a service, a Green Paper calls on the us an insight into the current state of insurance in the Member States and, at the same time allowed pointers for the future, and congratulate him on the content of support. </seg>
<seg id=1042> Both build on a three pillars model: the state, the occupational and private. </seg>
<seg id=1043> With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced certain rules. To this end, it has presented a Green Paper, from the then emerged the draft directive. </seg>
<seg id=1044> (EN) Mr President, I would like to Mr Rocard thank and congratulate him on his report, and also Mr Marinos I congratulate the opinion of his committee. </seg>
<seg id=1045> This study will be able to be the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, in the proposed initiatives or measures. </seg>
<seg id=1046> With regard to the amendments tabled Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to say that they all have been adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1047> We have voted in favour of the key figures of the programme, to which the multidimensionale tackle the phenomenon, the measures in the areas of health, education and housing, consistency and complementarity with other neighbouring areas of policy, as well as the participation of non-state bodies, and also the social exclusion people themselves count. </seg>
<seg id=1048> This means that we must make use of the cyclical period of growth, with a balance or surplus to create. </seg>
<seg id=1049> Here I would just like to remind you that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission, from next year these very long-term aspect of public finances in relation to the ageing of the population in the assessment to include. </seg>
<seg id=1050> One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands is the special consideration - as I said at the beginning, the impact of the ageing of the population on the national budget in the coming years. </seg>
<seg id=1051> That is why is the accounts for the year 2000 in Germany a surplus of one and a half points of the gross domestic product. </seg>
<seg id=1052> We are still the change course development of the euro to the dollar in addition, we have a clear negative effect in terms of inflation. </seg>
<seg id=1053> Will continue to a public system with private capital education systems to reconcile, and they are obviously with support for the creation of specific compatible investment funds, the long-term tax can maintain and perhaps in the solution of the problem of the ageing of the population are to be useful. </seg>
<seg id=1054> Hence the third, we key principle, namely, the precautionary principle. </seg>
<seg id=1055> It must be remembered that, at the moment, a number of proposals for legislation to be discussed, all the efficiency and effectiveness of Community rules and, therefore, I hope, the strengthen consumer confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1056> But this relatively low incidence is no reason for complacency. </seg>
<seg id=1057> To be honest, I was disappointed that in yesterday' s statement by Prime Minister Jospin the extremely positive role of the Community in recent years has been acknowledged. </seg>
<seg id=1058> Of course, this calls for increased incidence of bse, not only in France but also in other Member States, according to statements. </seg>
<seg id=1059> The veterinary office to the Commission, with regard to the protection measures against bse, controls in the Member States are already high priority. </seg>
<seg id=1060> What its security is concerned, I would like to repeat that it is already a number of controls to ensure that meat and bone meal in the transfer of bse is no threat. </seg>
<seg id=1061> Yes, it may be hard to believe that it has taken four years to vote in favour of a measure which I for the protection of public health as a fundamental think. </seg>
<seg id=1062> Mr President-in-Office, I would specifically that the Council finally its opinion on the tse-verordnung announced. </seg>
<seg id=1063> In the current situation is the only way to break the cycle of bse-infektion, is that the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs completely to ban. </seg>
<seg id=1064> In this context, I would like to mention that we in the Liberal group have tabled an amendment, which I hope will be adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1065> The policy we have to change, so that the really for this crisis responsible in the duty to be taken and with practical decisions a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis is done. </seg>
<seg id=1066> They must therefore be reviewed. </seg>
<seg id=1067> The decided on labelling for beef, when it is a question of mindestetikettierung, the only for two and a half months is in force, it is not possible to proper traceability of the origin of animals, and that we have specified risk material far too late banned. </seg>
<seg id=1068> Citizens must be fully on the characteristics of the tests I have mentioned will be informed. </seg>
<seg id=1069> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at the time you have nothing or almost nothing, as well as their colleagues in view of the impact of Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic or the contaminated blood products have been inactive. As a reason has always stated that we want to the public not to panic. </seg>
<seg id=1070> The French ban will lead to a massive need increase, but the supply of this resource is limited. </seg>
<seg id=1071> Consumers have lost their confidence, and in order to put an end to this phenomenon areas must compulsory bse-tests introduced for cattle and sheep. </seg>
<seg id=1072> Important now is, in the spirit of the Commission' s proposal to work that meat meal the highest safety standards. </seg>
<seg id=1073> Otherwise, I am, for once Â­ entirely agree with what the honourable, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs GrossetÃªte said. </seg>
<seg id=1074> Because time happening, the Council and the Commission, you have a sufficient financial basis and can now a vigorous policy carried out. </seg>
<seg id=1075> We must tackle this problem. </seg>
<seg id=1076> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am very pleased to see here in this Chamber to hear that the gap at any price to review. </seg>
<seg id=1077> We have the soil, the climate and the necessary know-how Â­, in order meal immediately by not genetically modified plant proteins to replace, and yet we have to give up the right, on our own soil for our animal feed and food of plant proteins required people to grow, while at the same time we finance land. For this reason, our group has tabled an amendment in which the Council and the Commission are called upon to to find ways in order in Europe the cultivation of this plant proteins to increase again, the an appropriate to replace animal meal prionenhaltiges and American genetically modified soya are. </seg>
<seg id=1078> Foodstuffs must the people of safe food guarantee. </seg>
<seg id=1079> I think it is exemplary that France has managed to this step to take. </seg>
<seg id=1080> But you help the gentlemen not! </seg>
<seg id=1081> That is why I am surprised that, under these circumstances, dead still processed or recycled must be. </seg>
<seg id=1082> Recently in Britain the Phillips inquiry into bse published. </seg>
<seg id=1083> I would like to the European Commission to propose that the precautionary principle in beef from France also apply. </seg>
<seg id=1084> We still have no certainty and therefore need to know what the scientific evidence is and what measures are needed. </seg>
<seg id=1085> Furthermore, I have, of course, all the proposals noted, for which I well aware am. </seg>
<seg id=1086> If citizens come from the Member States and I reports, the legislation would not properly or not fully implemented, then perhaps we should think again about that, but not because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because it in the European Union in compliance with the law lacking. </seg>
<seg id=1087> If we are not to listen, then it invites us best not only a. </seg>
<seg id=1088> The Commission is of the opinion that the readmission agreements for the clarification and coordination of these measures to play an important role, and at the moment of the negotiations on the first of the Community readmission agreement with Russia, Sri Lanka, in Pakistan and Morocco. </seg>
<seg id=1089> What proposals the Commission has on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union? </seg>
<seg id=1090> (the President cut off the speaker) </seg>
<seg id=1091> The aim in this period was the reduction of the public deficit to achieve a more satisfactory monetary policy, lower interest rates and a higher growth. </seg>
<seg id=1092> I always say that the euro on 1 January 2002 will be introduced, we already have it in our pockets, we have it in different coin, but we have it in our pockets. </seg>
<seg id=1093> The current limit values for nitrogen dioxide and lead were not exceeded, not even the ozone threshold value in Athens city centre in accordance with directive 92/72 eg. It should be noted, however, that the measurements of the high summer have been made. </seg>
<seg id=1094> Subject: State aid for the audiovisual sector in a seminar of the French Presidency on the subject of cultural industries was a representative of the Directorate-General for competition of the European Commission is of the opinion that the the legal imposed channels investment commitments fact that the legislator were mandatory, state aid would be. </seg>
<seg id=1095> It must be respected and protected ". </seg>
<seg id=1096> But that does not happen by itself, because this new growth is very inegalitÃ¤r and can, as we in the usa for almost a decade observe, by continuing phenomena of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty and the urban ghettos be accompanied. </seg>
<seg id=1097> The governments of the Member States have this definition does not accept the rather too easy and meaningless. </seg>
<seg id=1098> In the incurred harsh climate there are more and more people who cannot compete, are isolated and be excluded. </seg>
<seg id=1099> Mr President, in this high House we hear very often, similar to a litany of how the European social model and the social market economy, to be praised, as many of my a contrast to the chaotic model of the United States of America would form. </seg>
<seg id=1100> (technical disruption) </seg>
<seg id=1101> This is an enormous amount of money. </seg>
<seg id=1102> We must also involved all political levels. </seg>
<seg id=1103> I agree that it is necessary, the causes of poverty to know better. I am in favour of preventive measures through innovative and practical responses involving the social partners, local and national administrations and the joint action of the citizens against exclusion as a result of mergers, restructuring and relocation of companies, depopulation and the strong populated urban areas. </seg>
<seg id=1104> We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of the social and structural reforms. </seg>
<seg id=1105> This is a legal problem, because the text of the Treaty only on social exclusion and not on poverty referred. </seg>
<seg id=1106> These proposals are, I think a pragmatic response to their request. </seg>
<seg id=1107> However, agreement on the strategy does not necessarily imply support for the detail. </seg>
<seg id=1108> If we a clear, binding framework for the Member States to define should the different systems of the requirements of course must meet, a longer period of probation. </seg>
<seg id=1109> Renewable energies are not a panacea for solving this problem. But there is no doubt that it considerably to its ease and also to the diversification of energy sources and to reduce our dependence on oil and gas can contribute, what we are also well would have. </seg>
<seg id=1110> I want to three of our demands again. </seg>
<seg id=1111> The setting of realistic objective guidelines can only the confidence of the citizens in the energy policy pursued increase. </seg>
<seg id=1112> In my opinion, has a consistent policy in the field of renewable energy a symbol effect on the future of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1113> With these agreements, finally, the Member States must show the European Union that they make a contribution to achieving the Kyoto objectives. </seg>
<seg id=1114> It would be a pity if a category would excluded, the overall to Erwirtschaftung of energy from waste can contribute be it for small projects or as part of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id=1115> The creation of peat in the assimilation and forest faithful to create is similar to that of other vegetable Biomassen. </seg>
<seg id=1116> Mr Chichester, I would like to say that, in my own country coast at sea already very modern wind farms have been in place. It is a project that certainly very soon, running. </seg>
<seg id=1117> The dispute over the phasing-out of nuclear power, which, for example, in Sweden and Germany will be held, has shown that without visible environmentally friendly and a competitive price to implement energy alternatives necessarily the debate in the coming is. </seg>
<seg id=1118> That is why the Member States need binding targets. </seg>
<seg id=1119> That is why I am optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy sources is concerned, as long as the right incentives are created. </seg>
<seg id=1120> I believe that it is a great deal of courage to do so, renewable energy always so to position, as it deserves. </seg>
<seg id=1121> A very strong increase in oil prices is undoubtedly with greater rigour in mind the problems with our dependence on fossil energy sources combined. </seg>
<seg id=1122> We can therefore amendment no 28 cannot accept. </seg>
<seg id=1123> However, it respects very fact that the concepts employed no interference in be its right of initiative and that it is not incompatible with the internal electricity market must be. </seg>
<seg id=1124> In the Commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where 25 000 lives widows, was under 26 participants merely a woman. </seg>
<seg id=1125> Although the proportion of women has been relatively low, studies have shown that the presence of women in the peacekeeping troops un to improve relations with the people on the ground and the general morality leads. </seg>
<seg id=1126> The report Theorin is in this area very in detail and also in repetition, which we in the group of the European people' s Party and European Democrats ask, in the sense of an official document to be abolished. </seg>
<seg id=1127> Politically speaking, I can this amendment no 19 rather than tactical defeat or tactical indicate withdrawal as content values compromise, and it should actually unworthy of women matter. </seg>
<seg id=1128> They were imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id=1129> Also Portugal, where women, of course, only after the April revolution of 1974 access to received diplomacy, has recently with East Timor and our Ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Gomes, shown how the role of women and their awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people, the 25 years in his freedom struggle alone, state of the world, and in particular here in the European Parliament can be carried out. </seg>
<seg id=1130> So far we have only very few of you have done two or three, I understand. </seg>
<seg id=1131> It is therefore important that in future this dimension in the development of the policy of the European Union, be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id=1132> Unfortunately, the terms are not defined, and there will be no distinctions made. </seg>
<seg id=1133> Send you ask the Council protest. </seg>
<seg id=1134> They are people with other experiences Â­ experience for the governance and, in particular, for the settlement of conflicts are indispensable. </seg>
<seg id=1135> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=1136> Secondly, if the sector is to be regulated by law, must, of course, a number of points to be studied. </seg>
<seg id=1137> In the last few weeks, I have noticed that, both in international trade union circles and in certain national trade unions great interest. </seg>
<seg id=1138> Second objection: are you will also ensure that housewives a pay have? </seg>
<seg id=1139> All those who are currently working in the black economy, then received a work under decent social conditions. </seg>
<seg id=1140> Furthermore have also for this project often result already two to three families together and budgetary support together made. </seg>
<seg id=1141> We were at a plenary session during the first October part-session, when we in our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the courageous learned reaction of the Serbian people, following which we immediately, you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of sanctions international demanded. </seg>
<seg id=1142> So that Europe has the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and its political creativity in shaping the future development of road demonstrated. </seg>
<seg id=1143> There must be no doubt at all that the question of the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1144> On the other hand, we would like to have a chance of Europe to show that we by their own efforts and in recognition of the real principles of democracy, are capable of constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia to develop. </seg>
<seg id=1145> I must say that I, as I was with you spoke - very impressed of it was, as you this extremely difficult situation meisterten and how determined you were. </seg>
<seg id=1146> This will be in the next protocol put in order, Mr Watson. </seg>
<seg id=1147> Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions enables citizens, the decision-making bodies accountable and proposes to greater effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1148> The fifth important amendment is, in my view, one of annual reporting, above all, on the documents that will remain secret to, or at least still secret. </seg>
<seg id=1149> This issue has not been clarified, and there is the possibility that regulations that the limit more transparency, remain in force, and, amongst other things, on this point, we have tabled amendments. </seg>
<seg id=1150> The Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy is opposed to the proposal to documents, the foreign or security issues affect automatically and as a whole by the principle of public access to official records exclude. </seg>
<seg id=1151> If we want the citizens really can enjoy their rights, we need in these contact points specially trained staff, the citizens seeking information, as it were, in the hands and as Pfadfinder by the complicated maze of the institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1152> Registers are essential if we do not want to see from the public a insider public. </seg>
<seg id=1153> It is very good that we have succeeded in Parliament, a broad majority in favour of more transparency to create. </seg>
<seg id=1154> Mr President, I would like to begin by the rapporteurs, thank you for your very good piece of work. </seg>
<seg id=1155> Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are in a good light. </seg>
<seg id=1156> Should be the case, then that is a disappointment, because what is at stake is the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1157> Under document we understand today a variety of things and we want to as wide as possible access to many document types in various forms ensure. </seg>
<seg id=1158> Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the files is from the internal see manual, which, on 11 October to the staff of the Commission has been distributed and in which they be informed, as you requests for access to documents by Members should deal with. </seg>
<seg id=1159> This provision must be abolished or at least the duty of an exchange of interests be supplemented. </seg>
<seg id=1160> The normal kind of international cooperation with the diplomatic practices and rules - that for example everything behind closed doors is - is not relevant to modern forms of cooperation, as the Eu have been developed. </seg>
<seg id=1161> We should it not with the role of the European Parliament or in future interinstitutional agreements confuse. </seg>
<seg id=1162> It was a step forward on the use of the right of citizens to information and knowledge done. </seg>
<seg id=1163> However, it is not the only one to which I would like to express my thanks to a great should also like to thank Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen of the ppe-de-fraktion, on the basis of the consolidated Hughes procedure Mitverfasserin of the report. </seg>
<seg id=1164> Transparency must to a fundamental aspect of the work of the European Union as a whole, but enough the right of access to the documents are, for the implementation of the transparency does not in itself. </seg>
<seg id=1165> The European Parliament therefore calls for the European security and defence policy in the future in the structures of the European Commission will be involved. </seg>
<seg id=1166> As President Prodi on 3 October went to Parliament, he spoke of the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a to checks and balances European system based the smooth funktionieren each institution to the common interest contributes. </seg>
<seg id=1167> I must admit that the great challenge in this regulation the precise definition of the documents. </seg>
<seg id=1168> I would like to stress that the Commission, when the time comes practically all of the amendments could accept, as no </seg>
<seg id=1169> In some cases, I would like to vote in favour of the proposals of the Commission, and for that should the Members of the list of the amendments which the Commission can support, and with the amendments that you do not want to support, in the hands. </seg>
<seg id=1170> Own resources of credit institutions </seg>
<seg id=1171> Finally, and this was the most controversial point, asked the Committee strongly a fast-track procedure for the implementation of this legislation. </seg>
<seg id=1172> These changes are in the place of a number of other proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the voting and now be replaced by the new amendments, which are the result of this consensus. </seg>
<seg id=1173> Mr President, in view of the excellent vote for this report and the Commission' s reply this morning is clearly, if you look at all parts on which we voted, that we, in accordance with rule 69 (2) the vote on the legislative resolution should be postponed in order to with the Commission and the Council in successful negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=1174> Mr President, I am sorry to say that the group of the European people' s Party and European Democrats (ppe-de) the postponement of the vote in favour of, but I must point out that your coordinator to me has come to tell me that the vote until the session of November ii wanted to postpone, instead of this evening to vote. </seg>
<seg id=1175> I would from another reason for a postponement of the vote propose - Mr Goebbels has already said, this is a very important matter. </seg>
<seg id=1176> I do not know what a roll-call vote costs, but there are certainly a number of thousands of francs or Belgian francs from our budget. </seg>
<seg id=1177> I know that in France whole herds were slaughtered, and this does not seem the best solution. </seg>
<seg id=1178> Removal of meal from the feed, not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs, poultry and fish, </seg>
<seg id=1179> That is not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1180> Such provisions would be appropriate, consumer confidence restore and the farmers solidarity message to send, which we you send want. </seg>
<seg id=1181> There is an urgent need to go further - and an amendment to the common agricultural policy to consider. </seg>
<seg id=1182> The ban on the use of meat and bone meal as animal feed is only the first step on this path. </seg>
<seg id=1183> On the other hand, we very much regret that the our group has tabled amendments were not adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1184> In my opinion, it would be logical to the working time of workers in the harmful to betrieben reduce. </seg>
<seg id=1185> Let me finally stress once again that the general spread of the use of hazardous waste us not get must deal with the production of waste '. </seg>
<seg id=1186> If, for example, the pensions do not be so low that it for the livelihoods are not enough, there would be less poor. </seg>
<seg id=1187> The report provides for an appropriation of EUR 100 million for a period of five years to reduce poverty. </seg>
<seg id=1188> The proposal, a second Luxembourg process in the area of social exclusion, which includes guidelines and national action plans, receives my unqualified support. </seg>
<seg id=1189> The report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators for the social exclusion. </seg>
<seg id=1190> With the presentation of its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission the request of the Council, after " by June 2000 ' a ' initiative for the cooperation in this area ' to produce. </seg>
<seg id=1191> Mr President, I have asked for a very specific reason contain the vote: with this report, in my view, from the environmental point of view not achieved the progress that I hoped and wished. </seg>
<seg id=1192> I hope that this system in all European cities widespread will. </seg>
<seg id=1193> Some of the European Parliament' s proposals are unrealistic and do not think my approval. </seg>
<seg id=1194> Also it must in future be able better to existing best practice publicly known. </seg>
<seg id=1195> Environment informed GroÃverdiener have the possibility, in a liberalised market voluntarily to contribute to a cleaner energy, while for the other things as old remains. </seg>
<seg id=1196> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: </seg>
<seg id=1197> It is the following three reasons: firstly, this proposal is in line with the process of consolidating democracy and the increased demand for respect for human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous peoples. </seg>
<seg id=1198> In this debate, we would like previous speakers rightly said, the solidarity and support of our institution vis-Ã -vis the Central American Parliament to express. This is happening at a time when we are working to ensure that the external relations of the European Union with the countries of Iberoamerikas continue to be a priority. </seg>
<seg id=1199> I do not have reservations about the human rights, our colleague and dear friend, Mr Seguro, President of the delegation responsible for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, authorised was to. </seg>
<seg id=1200> Finally, the Commission is also in the dialogue with the Central American authorities repeatedly to the importance that we the regional integration process as a tool for the consolidation of democracy and the attach to development in this area must. </seg>
<seg id=1201> In order to brackets of the power, he has not hesitated to the senseless debate on the IvoritÃ¤t " to themselves, which gave rise to a wave of xenophobia: hatred on the other, the fremden, the burkinabÃ© or the malinesen, of which a very large number of for many years to life ivorischem ground and work. </seg>
<seg id=1202> A precondition for the creation of a genuine democracy in CÃ´te d'Ivoire is the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry on the crimes committed and the formal commitment to respect human rights and the internal peace. </seg>
<seg id=1203> Some believe that democracy is of relative importance when it Africa is concerned, these are complex procedures and should be the time for work. On the other hand, I am of the opinion that it in terms of democracy, no compromise can be and that in CÃ´te d'Ivoire today the same question as, for example, in Guinea, where we know that people are imprisoned and there is no democratic system. </seg>
<seg id=1204> Let me conclude by saying one thing: dictatorships are only possible because there are people who lives in poverty, the no access to knowledge and information. </seg>
<seg id=1205> It would be illogical if the European Union is today called for new presidential elections, in which this time all the candidates could take part. </seg>
<seg id=1206> In many parts of Africa, we are dealing with very different ethnic and religious mixtures to do. </seg>
<seg id=1207> In these elections must allows national representation of the political parties, which were excluded from the presidential election, so, even if only in part, the shortcomings of the first election compensate for. </seg>
<seg id=1208> On the situation in Burma </seg>
<seg id=1209> It is a large-scale offensive against the Shan and the Karen led and, as the un rapporteur said, there is no sign of a dialogue between sdpc and nld. </seg>
<seg id=1210> That is why we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction. </seg>
<seg id=1211> I hope that the European Parliament by the handling of this matter in the topical and urgent debate is the Burmese people a clear signal that its desperate situation is not forget that we see that the situation in Burma rather worse than better, and that we are determined to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id=1212> It has taken a long time. </seg>
<seg id=1213> It is precisely in Asia, there is a danger that economic and political reforms be decoupled that it economic progress and economic liberalisation can be without liberalisation in the political field and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that without a functioning state under the rule of law in the long term trade, subsidies and investment are lost. </seg>
<seg id=1214> Mr President, I can previous speakers in many key respects agree, because much of what today is happening in Vietnam, is not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1215> The human rights organisation human rights watch, which Mr Swoboda said, has now stated that Vietnam is precisely in the issue of human rights recently some has made to improve the situation. </seg>
<seg id=1216> This strictly secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese government. </seg>
<seg id=1217> However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation is only on a dialogue between the military regime, the elected democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities can be achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1218> There is also a clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of self-censorship the own press. </seg>
<seg id=1219> The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions: </seg>
<seg id=1220> We also need the help and support of the Eu, not only in the south-west of England, but in all areas affected. </seg>
<seg id=1221> I would ask you all to support our resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1222> It is imperative that the European Union does not in extraordinary aid after the entry of disasters limited. </seg>
<seg id=1223> To that end, the Commission has taken two initiatives. </seg>
<seg id=1224> Mr President, it is a a purely linguistic errors in the inclusion of the amendments to the joint motion for a resolution has arisen. </seg>
<seg id=1225> To postpone the vote, means that the mandate given to the Commission to postpone. </seg>
<seg id=1226> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=1227> The report is based on the observation that a growing proportion of supporting patients in Europe by addition sick insurance cover. </seg>
<seg id=1228> I find it rather strange that one of the Commission already the hands want to commit to a proposal for a directive, but at the same time a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and sick addition insurance ask the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1229> In view of the fact that the in the elderly people is increasing greatly, it is important that the improvement of health care for the people throughout Europe to contemplate. </seg>
<seg id=1230> That of course we can do not go along with. </seg>
<seg id=1231> Mr President, much speaks for a fast-track procedure in the implementation of the results of the Basel revision of the kapitaladÃ¤quanz-regelungsrahmens. </seg>
<seg id=1232> As far as that is concerned sense of urgency, that Mrs Villiers still on the feeling conveyed by the Commission is on the point of put the need, by the adoption of measures in asking for a fast-track procedure, that is to say that the rapporteur acknowledges that this does not affect the will have anti-competitive practices which, unfortunately, widespread in the United States. </seg>
<seg id=1233> Of course we must also ensure that Basel not additional means that the banks by increasing capital requirements still a second drawback is. </seg>
<seg id=1234> Having said that, I would like to point out that the operators in my opinion, the approach regard as satisfactory, the rules on capital, the issues in connection with the risk, abstÃ¼tzen is based. </seg>
<seg id=1235> These are some initial thoughts on how we, within the current rules of the Treaty could achieve a swift legislative process, the control and efficiently. </seg>
<seg id=1236> That is now the time has come to recognise that the institution of the European Ombudsman " big enough and is already sufficient evidence has been that they have the maturity for a separate budget has. </seg>
<seg id=1237> The ppe-de-fraktion supports the opinion of the Committee on constitutional Affairs that the powers of the Ombudsman should be widened, the sooner the better, especially with regard to the in Article 3 of the decision of 1994 established the Ombudsman' s powers of investigation. </seg>
<seg id=1238> An ombudsman, of course, subject to judicial confidentiality requirements, but it is important for the citizens to know that he or she as Ombudsman access to files can the other citizens remain closed. </seg>
<seg id=1239> The starting point of this report was then by the Ombudsman addressed to the Commission recommendation, in its organised competitions access of applicants to their own auditing work as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1240> We believe that the recruitment of the institutions of the Community and, in fact, all of recruitment, with maximum openness and transparency are should, at any suspicion of bias, injustice or incompetence exclude the administration. </seg>
<seg id=1241> I am referring, for example, to an amendment concerning the requirement for the indisputable evidence of an oral examination. </seg>
<seg id=1242> Mr BÃ¶sch has already briefly on the amendments to the report referred. </seg>
<seg id=1243> Having to the Commission two questions on the implementation and organisation of the last internal had put out to tender, I have precise and detailed answers given. </seg>
<seg id=1244> So processes are open and transparent. </seg>
<seg id=1245> Firstly, with regard to the checks carried out by the Commission be the corrections always anonymously. </seg>
<seg id=1246> Was meant clearly July 2000. </seg>
<seg id=1247> Votes </seg>
<seg id=1248> (Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote) </seg>
<seg id=1249> In the assessment of the directive on the own resources of credit institutions must carefully several in conflict between interests can be assessed. </seg>
<seg id=1250> It is the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and for the candidate countries have been created. </seg>
<seg id=1251> This position the rapporteur, and the European people' s Party shares it too. </seg>
<seg id=1252> The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union demands actually necessarily cross-border cooperation between the various police forces. </seg>
<seg id=1253> Most of the other speakers think it obviously is crucial that the College one permanent seat. </seg>
<seg id=1254> The umpteenth time being, but not widerrufliche decision of the Council usually Parliament a small gift power. </seg>
<seg id=1255> The rapporteur would also like to crime prevention, provision of services, innovation and monitoring of the borders involved know and the safeguarding of internal security in terms of the maintenance of public order amended see. </seg>
<seg id=1256> These were the ideals, you have suggerierten, and that was the state, for which it was. </seg>
<seg id=1257> A levelling of standards in certain Member States of the European Union I would welcome. </seg>
<seg id=1258> Since the initial considerations in relation to this issue, on the initiative of the European Parliament have been made at European level, the Commission has committed itself to the Member States, an action with the aim to bring to the way to build something that we, as the European police culture could see at the highest level of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against crime is based. </seg>
<seg id=1259> This is planning a development of the police College primarily at government level. </seg>
<seg id=1260> For the above-mentioned reasons, to vote in favour of the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece is against the report. </seg>
<seg id=1261> (SV) I voted against the provisional establishment of the European police College voted in favour. </seg>
<seg id=1262> There is no doubt that many of our courts very slowly and bedÃ¤chtig, and it is very difficult to you in these matters to a rapid action to move. </seg>
<seg id=1263> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, because it is based on the brÃ¼ssel-ii-verordnung not for children of separated living and single parents. </seg>
<seg id=1264> My mother has such a divorce abduction and persuasion before 85 years, and it is still of it today. </seg>
<seg id=1265> I would therefore like to say to the House that the Commission' s action programme on the mutual recognition of civil law decisions - which we hope will be adopted by the end of the year, proposing that the extension of the scope of the brÃ¼ssel-ii-verordnung and so that this regulation on the Supreme visiting rights and to the highest priority, so that they without distinction for children he or she were the married couples equally apply to children from partnerships. </seg>
<seg id=1266> We shall now proceed to the vote. </seg>
<seg id=1267> Now is the sport - it must be said - closely linked to other sectors, for example, with undertakings of the audiovisual sector or the advertising and sport Article sale. </seg>
<seg id=1268> What we need is an intelligent and flexible interpretation of the current rules. </seg>
<seg id=1269> In fact, it is an attack on democracy, much as we also object to the things from this point of view see. </seg>
<seg id=1270> The Commission therefore expected shortly an answer to your request at detailed information on the measures proposed by the British government. </seg>
<seg id=1271> The proposal, the finance ministers in connection with a preliminary draft budget half a year before the statement on the general budget in the spring of 2001, presented. </seg>
<seg id=1272> I also think what Mr Simpson said in extraordinary way contributed to us in terms of the likely intentions of the United Kingdom government to confirm. </seg>
<seg id=1273> By traffic jams we lose not only a lot of time, not only does high costs, but it is precisely for the environment a huge problem, and that is why I believe that if the British government actually the money committed to solve the problems, then all have something about this, in particular all the citizens of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1274> We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet have the highest petrol and diesel prices of all the countries of Europe - 1 point Â£ 20 we figures in the United Kingdom a litre for diesel. </seg>
<seg id=1275> That concludes this item. </seg>
<seg id=1276> The European Parliament has a duty to assure you that it is on your side. I would ask you again to observe a minute' s silence for our solidarity and our concern to express. </seg>
<seg id=1277> Madam President, I would like to support this proposal wholeheartedly, because I am one of those who have requested that this issue be included. </seg>
<seg id=1278> We have come a long way. </seg>
<seg id=1279> The Eu their relations to develop the main groups and also as quickly as possible with the new government in the usa in contact. </seg>
<seg id=1280> In view of the Â­ what a surprise Â­ enthusiastic report by Mr Prescott, on the deal he himself has negotiated, I cannot understand why he not only by Mrs Voynet, but, in my view, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, by almost all the other European environment ministers was rejected. </seg>
<seg id=1281> Now there is a risk that we have lost the impetus, the American negotiator change its position, and we in may completely from the start. </seg>
<seg id=1282> The great contentious issue this time the forests. </seg>
<seg id=1283> A constant warming of the earth would have for some eu-lÃ¤nder means that share flooded their territory or versteppt. </seg>
<seg id=1284> They have a high level of prosperity and low prices of oil products. </seg>
<seg id=1285> I would like to congratulate Mrs WallstrÃ¶m on her efforts in the Hague and wish her more success. </seg>
<seg id=1286> There is no doubt that it was better to any agreement to come as a bad, because the American proposal was totally inadequate and for Europe certainly not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1287> Climate change in the developing countries far-reaching consequences. </seg>
<seg id=1288> I would like to repeat Englisch: forest turns from Being sinks bis carbon Sources. </seg>
<seg id=1289> Only if the European Union continues to be credible, it can in the discussions and the actual measures on the cop6- " B " in Bonn take the initiative. </seg>
<seg id=1290> We have our own assessment of the events and documents preparing to deal with the various parties and, of course, the umbrella group " to enter into contact. </seg>
<seg id=1291> Of course there is a step in the wake of the next cop6 or the continuation of the cop6 is that the agreement then in the Union is ratified. </seg>
<seg id=1292> Before the European Council we will, in other words, Pierre Moscovici and I, next Sunday still a klausursitzung at ministerial level, to carry out the I Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos have invited, and on Monday, at the Council of general Affairs ' will be a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference to be held. </seg>
<seg id=1293> The minimum number of Member States is to set eight, while the opportunity to call for a unanimous decision of the Council, which is currently a de facto veto is replaced by a recourse to law. </seg>
<seg id=1294> This is to be regretted, but I must this fact stick. </seg>
<seg id=1295> The European Council will also with the state of enlargement negotiations and, therefore, with the enlargement deal. </seg>
<seg id=1296> The Lisbon European Council had guidelines for the promotion of innovative and competitive Europe adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1297> The consumer protection is for obvious reasons, to which I not dwell must always be a matter of concern to the bedeutenderes Europeans. </seg>
<seg id=1298> We need to look at this unprecedented enlargement prepare. </seg>
<seg id=1299> This is, in fact, the criterion on which we ultimately assess the Nice Summit. </seg>
<seg id=1300> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1301> Firstly, the applicant countries assume the acquis communautaire and implement. That is our task. </seg>
<seg id=1302> We are very much in the Charter of fundamental rights, and we do not want it to only great promoted. </seg>
<seg id=1303> The text could, however, be better formulated, but it can also after Nice rectified and be clarified. </seg>
<seg id=1304> I think it is simply out of the question that several governments the issue of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty simply brushed off the table. </seg>
<seg id=1305> They want it does not even include in the Treaties, which is proof that this text, this Elaborat, be put aside. </seg>
<seg id=1306> In the wto should we with a single voice unpleasant arise. </seg>
<seg id=1307> I think that, given the rather gloomy prospects of the burden of the Intergovernmental Conference with another complex issue and Kontroversen no wise move would be. </seg>
<seg id=1308> I strongly urge the French Presidency, to companies the greatest possible effort to ensure that this gulf is closed, because it has a highly destructive. </seg>
<seg id=1309> To trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which requires careful consideration. </seg>
<seg id=1310> Although with the previous Treaty some progress with regard to the expansion of the formula could be achieved, was therefore the crazy formula including the codecision of unanimity in issues of nationality, social security, the inclusion of self-employed and exercise acquisition activities and of cultural policy launched. </seg>
<seg id=1311> The fact that this issue is in itself a clear evidence of the failure of a policy to strengthen the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=1312> That is the situation in which we in this Intergovernmental Conference are for months, because no one be toys abandon. </seg>
<seg id=1313> The experiences of this year lead us to say that we in the progress made, which, after Nice, with a view to the future of Europe in the constitutionalisation process of the Union have to be made, not on the now exhausted method of solely between the government representatives negotiations must confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1314> Will the not qualified majority voting the general rule, it will be, as Mr Prodi was quite right to point out that the decision-making definitively blocked. </seg>
<seg id=1315> This aspect of subsidiarity has been in our debate today not mentioned, however, is of great importance. </seg>
<seg id=1316> We have done so, the enlargement of 1995 has taken place, it was the by Carlos Westendorp so careful reflection group chairman, it was Amsterdam, and we are now Nice, and are practically the same point, Mr President: we circles to the institutional issues without to find solutions that will enable us to fulfil a very challenging task of enlargement to 27,. </seg>
<seg id=1317> Let us not the disappointment that the Nice Conference already will lead to, if you without end result, the major disappointment of the people on our Parliament add. </seg>
<seg id=1318> In the past we have demonstrated that this objective is possible, and as a citizen of a Member State, of a planned transition to membership has benefited, I see an enlarged and peaceful Europe with great expectations against. </seg>
<seg id=1319> But if we even have a right of veto, it must be clear that this is also for all the other to apply. </seg>
<seg id=1320> However, is a first change in 2004 to be elected Parliament be necessary, because at least some Member States before the elections or during the legislative period 2004-2009 to happen. </seg>
<seg id=1321> The President-in-Office of the Council has addressed the question of closer cooperation and said that we moving in this matter to a consensus. </seg>
<seg id=1322> Mr President, at first sight it is in Nice to the leftovers and to the adjustments necessary in the light of enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=1323> We have just a glimmer of those mentality, insofar as we to negative developments in our part of the world less emphasis placed and positive processes which more focus on the could, then we would be happier than is currently the case. </seg>
<seg id=1324> We should not only the movement of goods, but also the built up bodies of services, investment, intellectual property and competition in include the majority of the Council of Ministers and the Article 133 (1) of the Treaty changed. </seg>
<seg id=1325> The right of initiative of the European Parliament would also, however, in this highly sensitive political issue arbitrariness open. </seg>
<seg id=1326> We must therefore also be able, as one of you said, when he to the American optimism and referred to by the way in which the Americans are talking about, highlight what is what progress. </seg>
<seg id=1327> I would also like to say that I think it is not a problem of the large and the small countries. </seg>
<seg id=1328> We have done a great deal, but we always come back to this old problem, and I do not believe that this is a development would occur, only because moved a single country, because it is, I repeat, with a very strong national, political, democratic realities in twelve of the fifteen countries to do. </seg>
<seg id=1329> Mr President VÃ©drine, you have said that a perhaps spannungsgeladenes climate, and you have also by a certain degree of pessimism spoken. </seg>
<seg id=1330> Furthermore, I would like to ask all companies, in order to tighten up safety standards in a proper way so that this sort of incident does not happen again. </seg>
<seg id=1331> I believe that we arrangements for this have to take, we are still far from being taken that the guests of this Parliament in this House as guests can feel and not fear threat must have. </seg>
<seg id=1332> Hospitality here, hospitality and respect there too. </seg>
<seg id=1333> Thank you very much for your comments, Mr Tajani. </seg>
<seg id=1334> The best tribute we Ernest lluch and his life can be, it is, his message to follow, in Catalan it means dÃ¬aleg. We can all the dialogue in the Basque country a chance? </seg>
<seg id=1335> On the other hand, of course, everyone to express his opinions. </seg>
<seg id=1336> (B5-0549/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, to the Council on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan; </seg>
<seg id=1337> When I speak of organisation, then I also believe that the European Union, which is of such great effort, also in favour of the responsibility should be. </seg>
<seg id=1338> Secondly, you will be in the resolution the clear will of Parliament to the security and defence policy, on two balanced pillar reasons: the civil crisis management and in the event of a failure to the military crisis management, with these two pillars complement each other. </seg>
<seg id=1339> Mr President, in view of the late already seen and the commitments I still have, I shall try to the contribution that I had prepared a little to reduce. </seg>
<seg id=1340> These relations are particularly on meetings between the NATO Council and the copsi and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries and/or the allies produced. </seg>
<seg id=1341> As an example to the events in the Balkans, of which we can say that each of its full role performed. </seg>
<seg id=1342> During this period we have the usa also fully on the developments in the context of the European security and defence policy, on the kept laufenden, which is an essential condition for this is that they develop harmoniously, as it does at the moment. </seg>
<seg id=1343> It was the second annual report of the European Union on human rights submitted to the European Parliament, and a people right forum will on 13 December take place in Paris. </seg>
<seg id=1344> This policy, as you can see, does not in, for competitors to the Atlantic Alliance, which today the basis for the common defence of its members, or a constant European army establish. </seg>
<seg id=1345> If I the number of 10 0000 men have mentioned, then this does not mean that we in Helsinki set want to provide objective, but that we have a reserve of different qualifications and to specialise, so as to ensure that the objective of the relevant Council 60 000 men in all working conditions can be achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1346> Let me now in quite a few words on the by a large number of our public accepted real political point of this new task, deal with the Europe a so far lack of instrument of political influence acquired. </seg>
<seg id=1347> However, we are now faced with the problem must ensure that we, when the consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe is the speech, my the continent as a whole, because it is a matter for enlargement and the enlargement process. </seg>
<seg id=1348> Three areas we need to combine a coherent whole, the Community policies, the Gasp including the esvp and national policies of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1349> Despite the expensive procedures within the Commission we need not 60 000 soldiers strong force to achieve our goals. </seg>
<seg id=1350> We must, therefore, urgently find a way of humanitarian aid. </seg>
<seg id=1351> I do not agree with the Zynikern to say that Europe get so that a toys, which has nothing to do with. However, it is true that the rapid reaction force in many situations not immediately be. </seg>
<seg id=1352> The Eu should not have its own defence with fixed troops are. </seg>
<seg id=1353> Finally, I would like to the concern of my group, on the verschlimmernde situation in Afghanistan and express the Commission and call on the Council, as far as you are possible, their efforts for a peaceful solution and to strengthen support for the civilian population, especially now before the winter. </seg>
<seg id=1354> To use simple words terms, where, when and how should the European reaction force in future be used? </seg>
<seg id=1355> The interview shows how the appalling record of these two months intifada has been reached on the 270 deaths, mostly Palestinians, and almost 10 000 often for life disabled people injured,. </seg>
<seg id=1356> That is why it is also constantly trying to an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction schrecklichster kind of standards. </seg>
<seg id=1357> Secondly, and contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it would be possible or desirable that the European Union, in view of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East more than before is doing, especially now, during the transitional period, in which the usa are. </seg>
<seg id=1358> Mr President, in my speech I would like to refer to the report by Mrs LalumiÃ¨re, which, in my opinion, very good and clear. </seg>
<seg id=1359> But there is no political concept, real and there is still no common foreign and security policy. </seg>
<seg id=1360> The Eu has just a problem, namely that you the public interest for such actions not yet been won, although this considerably more and more effective. </seg>
<seg id=1361> Another point is, of course, the question of the distribution of the budget. </seg>
<seg id=1362> I say this in spite of the large number of insurance clear on this subject, which in the last few days as it so happens again and again I have. </seg>
<seg id=1363> Our potential is still very limited. The Member States should, at long last, to rethink their defence spending, which from country to country different. </seg>
<seg id=1364> Even those who the use, for example, of the decision to create question of the so-called European army, must the major political content of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union to recognise. </seg>
<seg id=1365> The first appearance of a defence Minister in our Parliament is so historically that we for it reserved the night sitting, so that the impression of our Members not to is strong. </seg>
<seg id=1366> For all these conflicts a civil crisis prevention is better than a military action. </seg>
<seg id=1367> Want to Russia, in the long term, political Union partners of an undemocratic regime? </seg>
<seg id=1368> Europe will therefore be no new military alliance, as some, I believe, probably as a result of incomplete information have indicated. </seg>
<seg id=1369> I have pursuant to rule 42 (5) of the rules of procedure, the motion for a resolution to wind up the debate received. </seg>
<seg id=1370> Given the scale of the task were affected four committees, which is why a new procedure with the drawing up of four reports simultaneous was applied. </seg>
<seg id=1371> The measures proposed in the White Paper have in their entirety serve to the whole functioning of the Commission to modernise and become more effective. </seg>
<seg id=1372> It would therefore be appropriate to the reform to take the opportunity, for your intervention to limit on the areas, not the expenditure side. </seg>
<seg id=1373> The encountered assessment differences are not only a political one, but a reflection, above all, the cultural differences between the fifteen. </seg>
<seg id=1374> The main task of the new internal audit service, which you, Mr Kinnock, as the for the reform directly Vice-President subject is the analysis of the internal control functions - and systems within the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1375> The cooperation has made great pleasure, and I believe that the process, the Commission to submit an important reform, which for the future of the European Union is so critically important, has to tiefe won and wealth, because we four involved. </seg>
<seg id=1376> They should expect, in other European institutions to or to the national governments to be remedied, or in the private sector to work. </seg>
<seg id=1377> Therefore points our committee once again to the importance of a strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible Commission attaches to. </seg>
<seg id=1378> As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the establishment of the budget after activities due to the lack of visibility of expenditure and because of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority problems. </seg>
<seg id=1379> That is the determination of Parliament illustrate this reform together with the Commission to impose. </seg>
<seg id=1380> Mr President, first of all I would like to all four rapporteurs for the work they have done thank. </seg>
<seg id=1381> This is shameful, in view of the fact that the Eu itself champion of the modernisation of the economy. </seg>
<seg id=1382> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteur to support the work of the Commission it is a fact that, on the recommendations of the Committee of independent experts not yet comprehensive and consistent response in terms of the quest for a real government policy and not just for a better management of the Commission is given. </seg>
<seg id=1383> The change in attitude is to be expressed in a transparent administration. </seg>
<seg id=1384> I believe that there are in the world no structure with greater importance and substantielleren than the 15, tomorrow 20 or more countries, an entire continent. The most industrialised part of the globe pulsiert in the Union and by you in the Commission on its structures. </seg>
<seg id=1385> Change is never easy. </seg>
<seg id=1386> It was the Socialist group, however, of the opinion that the management of Community law currently operates effectively. </seg>
<seg id=1387> We know the outcome, and that is why the many members of the Commission and its administration in detail and expertly with this issue has been. </seg>
<seg id=1388> Thousands of project applications are already on an evaluation a year. </seg>
<seg id=1389> As we have seen, the debate is not so much a question of principles, objectives or opportunities of the reform, but rather procedure, pace, timetable, possible problems or negative consequences of their implementation. </seg>
<seg id=1390> First of all I would like to inform this House that, as Mr van Hulten has already pointed out, on today' s meeting of the College of a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement was adopted, within the framework of a beratende group " rules governing the behaviour in the public service ' will be set up, as in action 1 of the action programme on the White Paper. </seg>
<seg id=1391> Mr van Hulten has this point in the course of this debate, as far as I know, up again. </seg>
<seg id=1392> The main aim of the new version is a simplification, increasing the transparency, the strengthening of the budget principles, this will mean in practical terms, fewer derogations, less incomprehensible exception, and it is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure. </seg>
<seg id=1393> It is quite simply very uneconomic for the Commission if Treaties be so that, for cost X 20 % be replaced for costs y 30 % be replaced and then often the evidence collected by kleinstbetrÃ¤gen and be examined. </seg>
<seg id=1394> The next item is the debate on the report by (A5-0337/2000) Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on the European Union' s relations with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission to (2000/2051(INI)) these relations. </seg>
<seg id=1395> The latter aspects relating in particular the nro. </seg>
<seg id=1396> Of course, this is not enough, but we should the in any case before excessive display of weakness of our development aid protect. </seg>
<seg id=1397> We have to come back, because in itself this is a reasonable framework. </seg>
<seg id=1398> Mr President, I am today returned from Mozambique, where the European Union following the tsunami excellent humanitarian aid has done, but once again and again construction projects, for which we already have the money provided, delayed, because not all signatures in Brussels meeting. </seg>
<seg id=1399> In view of this reality, a greater commitment and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment inevitable. </seg>
<seg id=1400> We now have a harmonised system for the preparation of country strategy papers and indicative programmes for cooperation in all developing countries. </seg>
<seg id=1401> Furthermore, was the establishment of Sem no solution to the further existing imbalance of eight unwieldy management bodies. </seg>
<seg id=1402> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have very special emphasis placed, today in this debate on the first package on maritime transport in the European Parliament to be present, because they deal with three major texts are concerned the first essential step in this area, which, unfortunately, the recent events so much attention to the public. </seg>
<seg id=1403> This would from a Presidency point of view the opportunity to discuss with the Member States in order, on the basis of their proposals, to reach an agreement in the Council and the text at first reading, if necessary, by qualified majority to adopt. </seg>
<seg id=1404> This rapid and effective action, the result of two Erika packages and six proposals are, has a huge momentum. </seg>
<seg id=1405> The lesson this morning Parliament must draw should to lead the fact that the law of the sea in the world in a shameful state and it is time that we put in order. </seg>
<seg id=1406> Of vessels, which do not meet the standards, must send out a clear signal that we in European waters or in European ports not tolerate. </seg>
<seg id=1407> In the tankers lower tonnage we are a compromise between the 5 000 tonnes of sustainability, the limit value of the imo, and 600 tonnes of sustainability, the proposed by the Commission ceiling made. </seg>
<seg id=1408> This information must the European, national and port authorities and the interested public be made available. </seg>
<seg id=1409> The limits on fundamental nature of the marine environment, namely that the pollution of an area can spread on a wider region, calls for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. </seg>
<seg id=1410> In the cooperation at local level will also environmental organisations involved. </seg>
<seg id=1411> The amendment of the directive in the form of a stricter application, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly as regards the selection of vessels up for review and the scope of the various on examining forms, is of course a positive values. </seg>
<seg id=1412> I would like to point out once again that the request for urgent procedure, which you now call for, is not in place. </seg>
<seg id=1413> I think that, in the ceiling of responsibility for the classification societies between the Council and Parliament will again be reviewed must, irrespective of what is decided today. </seg>
<seg id=1414> A tachograph, a black list, with all these things, we fully agree with. However, I would like to raise a couple of points. </seg>
<seg id=1415> In face of this disastrous situation and anarchic maritime Europe is the challenge, and eleven months after the wreck of the Erika, the European Union will be in a position to do a procedure which has been dealt with quickly, as any ever. </seg>
<seg id=1416> That no doubt discretion to what extent the liberal logic contrary to a high level of safety at sea. </seg>
<seg id=1417> What technical measures always be taken, one of the main source of uncertainty will continue unless we in the area channel and the North Atlantic exponential growth of transport because of the strangulation not stopped the North sea ports. </seg>
<seg id=1418> The President-in-Office of the Council, it would be good to see if it in his country of order. </seg>
<seg id=1419> Mr President, since the break-up of the tank ship Erika has been under political pressure a package of measures for the safety of vessels at sea to improve. </seg>
<seg id=1420> Greek ships were simply under, without in the area was storm, Mr Gayssot. </seg>
<seg id=1421> Thirdly, when we have this dossier speak, be clear that between our oil stockpile, on the one hand, and the fact that we continue to use fossil fuels, on the other hand, there is no link. </seg>
<seg id=1422> We finally have the political courage to our environmental ambitions to. </seg>
<seg id=1423> That is to say, in this area, we have a great responsibility and should, as it seems to me that any institutional own ladies leave aside. </seg>
<seg id=1424> For Finland, it is, for example, essential that Russia included in this agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1425> This relates to both the stricter requirements for the design of oil tankers, better rules for the port state control and the more stringent regulations for classification societies, which also be a result. </seg>
<seg id=1426> Mr President, today we are talking about the safety at sea on three reports, on which I congratulate the rapporteurs must. </seg>
<seg id=1427> With regard to the three new proposals on safety at sea is concerned, I think it is an urgent need, the three to congratulate rapporteur: they have, in a very short space of time the proof that our Parliament is determined to new measures to increase maritime safety, the strengthening of controls and stepping up to adopt the design standards, and that, in future, this type of disaster no longer be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id=1428> Madam President, a series of a high level of disasters, particularly with oil tankers, has, in the recent past our continent seriously affected. </seg>
<seg id=1429> More than 80 % of accidents are caused by human error, but for the human error there are reasons, the social nature. </seg>
<seg id=1430> Someone spoke of ' traceability '. </seg>
<seg id=1431> With the directive on port state control should compliance with international standards monitored and no new rules are introduced. </seg>
<seg id=1432> In amendment no 18, the port state control to the rest of the seamen placed in relationship. The implementation of the provisions on seafarers ' hours of work, however, is already covered by the existing directive 99/95 fully covered. </seg>
<seg id=1433> I note with pleasure that the rapporteur in amendment no 21 of a reference to the system has built on the assessment of the conditions, and we are in favour of the proposed thrust, but there is still some work to the wording, in order to all the more clearly. </seg>
<seg id=1434> Amendment no 4 and to point ' K ' regard one part of amendment no 18 is not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1435> I can assure you that a shipowner, of a ship in these flags to register intends to this its intention, as soon as our proposal is in force, should review. </seg>
<seg id=1436> The Commissioner has 18 minutes speaking and in this time dozens and dozens of articles quoted and the position of the Commission reported. </seg>
<seg id=1437> Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a package of measures concerning the trans-European network for the collection, production and distribution of the statistics of both inside and non-Community goods (Edicom) (KOM(00)0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201(COD)) (Committee on economic and monetary Affairs) </seg>
<seg id=1438> By I therefore withdrawing the motion for a resolution, I would like, however, to the belief to say that our Parliament its voice heard better have been able to give, when it comes to the meeting of the European Council in Nice a special and separate resolution on this very important and sensitive questions of the Intergovernmental Conference have not, in the context of a single, all other items on the agenda of the summit comprehensive resolution to deal with. </seg>
<seg id=1439> (with more than twelve Members who rose from their seats, which do not take account of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1440> Report by (A5-0337/2000) Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on the European Union' s relations with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000/2051(INI)) </seg>
<seg id=1441> I have it as a sign of protest done, because the European Union in this area are still not so intervene can, as it should have. </seg>
<seg id=1442> Although neither the proposal to amend the existing directive on port state control or the Watts report will respond to the real needs, they contain some in the right direction presents aspects. That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report. </seg>
<seg id=1443> It is therefore regrettable that, in the Commission' s proposal not taken on board the idea has been a real European coasts monitoring authority on the model of the United States ' existing Coast guards " set up. </seg>
<seg id=1444> A prerequisite for the safety of ships and the protection of life at sea and the environment are the fight the unaccountability of shipowners, apply strict measures to control the condition of vessels, the harsh punishment of ship societies, which violate the safety, the improvement of the working conditions of seafarers, their targeted training and a composition of the occupation in such a way that the increased demands on the ships will be able to play. </seg>
<seg id=1445> Unfortunately, the rapporteur makes Hatzidakis the opposite. </seg>
<seg id=1446> The sinking of the Erika in December 1999, the question of safety at sea, on the political agenda of the Community, and the Commission has these texts before us today, almost a year after the terrible accident, voted, under pressure from the European Parliament proposed. </seg>
<seg id=1447> The current compensation funds are not adequately equipped; it was only too clearly in the the Braer disaster where the the Shetland islands fishing industry for their losses not adequate compensation. </seg>
<seg id=1448> Madam President, I have already mentioned that I earlier dangers at sea am. </seg>
<seg id=1449> The rapporteur' s proposals, on the harmonisation aimed at European level, can only be positive. </seg>
<seg id=1450> The area concerned is very important, because it is the ship classification societies. </seg>
<seg id=1451> This would be rather a great success, because on the eve of enlargement, we need not rigid supranational Europe, the hierarchy and is far away, but a flexible, the people close Europe that is on respect for the basis of national democracies. </seg>
<seg id=1452> In the public increasingly ausgetragene power struggle between many Member States obscure the view of the possible compromises. </seg>
<seg id=1453> In Nice is the most important task is to ensure that the institutions of the Eu work efficiently. </seg>
<seg id=1454> Personally, I see the summit to be held in a week hope to. </seg>
<seg id=1455> I am not in favour of an automatic link of qualified majority voting and codecision and also believe here that any decision to extend the power of codecision, case by case must be taken. </seg>
<seg id=1456> With the amendment of Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam would Europe the qualified majority voting in the Council which currently apply for the trade in goods, in other areas, such as public services, intellectual property, health or education as well. </seg>
<seg id=1457> So that denied Parliament the right to influence, keeps quiet and be quiet in homage to the parteilichkeiten, the national responsibility and the governments and forgets its obligations towards the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1458> Furthermore, I have therefore voted against a text which the incorporation of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Treaty calls for, which adopted in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1459> It is a mistake, the Union split into two categories. That is why I cannot support that a third of the Member States is advancing at an even faster pace. </seg>
<seg id=1460> His new role heralded the end of the traditional neutrality, Sweden, Finland and Austria. </seg>
<seg id=1461> In this report there are many things, the British Conservatives will be able to give its support. This applies in particular to the emphasis to the placed on the enlargement of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=1462> The Danish social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the implementation of a common European security and defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=1463> But also against the peoples of the European Union, the new military expenditure, to which the report refers, in any case have to finance and which does not even have a guarantee that this forces one day in the name of " maintaining law and order " against they themselves are used. </seg>
<seg id=1464> Equally important is the proposal that a state in a task not wish to participate, will be obliged to make a financial contribution of the in this war States parties involved is shared out. </seg>
<seg id=1465> By external military means there is no solution, because they address not the cause of the conflict, and they lead to a shift in the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1466> That military operations funded from a budget line of the Community should be and the Member States a financial contribution for these tasks should do, even if they are not to participate wish (paragraphs 49 and 50). </seg>
<seg id=1467> On the other hand, it would be to the Eu do credit to if you reverse the priorities of the Peter Berg tasks and more to civil and humanitarian focus solution models. </seg>
<seg id=1468> I support this report by my colleague Maj Britt Theorin. </seg>
<seg id=1469> But the needs of this group will only be used as, at the call for the ' tax (N) deductibility of budget services ' and ' adjustment of prices and costs to the financial resources of individuals ' to make. </seg>
<seg id=1470> It is truly amazing that we in the 21st century, nor should recommend that the Member States for domestic workers right to adequate social security and pension should guarantee. </seg>
<seg id=1471> For many young people threatens undeclared work the first contact with the labour market. </seg>
<seg id=1472> The worst it is, if we are to women from countries Fernen is concerned, this work have forced adopted and no other way, see to make a living. </seg>
<seg id=1473> The reform of the Commission is following the results will be judged, therefore the need regular situation reports the Commission throughout the programme duration and the importance of December 2002 expected full assessment. </seg>
<seg id=1474> Not so long ago, it was as a result of various scandals and management weaknesses in March 1999 to the resignation of the European Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1475> Finally, I believe it is essential to remember that we in this for the future reform essential, at the same time, greater consistency and greater transparency the Commission in their day-to-day administration, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, under strict limit on the delegated their powers expect. </seg>
<seg id=1476> The Conservatives also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that the democratic control to ensure and the system of the three pillars of work to be done. </seg>
<seg id=1477> (the sitting was suspended at 115 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=1478> We have received information - and I would like to add straight away that I can you do not believe that the Council and President of France tomorrow only 30 minutes will be here to talk. </seg>
<seg id=1479> I therefore support a I full and reasoned opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1480> We should in any case vote, and I personally am in favour of a resolution, as Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others have proposed. </seg>
<seg id=1481> In these texts was to the night work, as is the number vote in favour of division in the Council and seats in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1482> Madam President, I would strongly urge that this de Roo report not be removed from the agenda, because it is very been well prepared. At the last earth Summit during the French Presidency will next Monday and Tuesday there is a common position drawn up. </seg>
<seg id=1483> Thank you very much, Mr Parish. </seg>
<seg id=1484> In the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, its chairman it is, smoke it often. </seg>
<seg id=1485> The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market, taking account of a high level of consumer protection and health, and that is based on existing legislation and new scientific findings. </seg>
<seg id=1486> It is about their standard of living and life view, in which the health become ever more important. </seg>
<seg id=1487> This rule is also to all consumed in the leisure, but not dangerous drugs, be applied if there is no other apart from these drugs konsumierenden person is affected. </seg>
<seg id=1488> Just yesterday were in the United States proceedings against multinational tobacco with convictions for poisoning and false information on the safety of products to an end. </seg>
<seg id=1489> With regard to the cigarettes in the Eu banned for health reasons, but exported from the European Union, we believe that the end these exports the only right and consistent. </seg>
<seg id=1490> Instead of the lessons from the failure of 9 October this year to draw in Luxembourg, we are in a position, which is not legally tenable. </seg>
<seg id=1491> I listened very carefully listened to what the Commissioner said to him: ' no massive job losses in this sector. </seg>
<seg id=1492> It is Parliament and the Council, the proposal for a directive to approve and, for example, the appropriate legal basis for this have to examine. </seg>
<seg id=1493> I do not think that such a narrow path cannot, because, regardless of the content, the substance is, as Mr Maaten and others aufzeigten there is the risk that this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions in their entirety, if this Parliament and the Council by the group chairmen of the European people' s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s proposed accept restrictive interpretation, in the legislative work of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law is, hands and feet tied. </seg>
<seg id=1494> Its weakness lies in the fact that the emphasis on the promotion of free competition is. </seg>
<seg id=1495> To conclude this: since the Treaty of Amsterdam is within the competence of the European Parliament, issues of coordinating environmental and consumer protection, and it is in this regard, of course, closely with the Council and the Commission to work together. </seg>
<seg id=1496> In fact that has nothing to do tobacco, but the decision of the eugh would as well, for example, to a ban on the advertising of alcohol can go or to a ban on chocolate, because, as you know, sugar be harmful to health. </seg>
<seg id=1497> I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wants to introduce export rules more generous than that of their own governments of the Member States is intended, those governments, but also the many sectors, represented on the out. </seg>
<seg id=1498> It has been proved that 80 % of smokers want to stop, but the tobacco industry only to offer a few strategies to these people to help. </seg>
<seg id=1499> If we insist that other countries to what standards they should set by our sensible proposals to extend the internal market in exports, so we are all the excellent work carried out by Mr Maaten in question. </seg>
<seg id=1500> We are in favour of the implementation of this tests by a test laboratory akkreditiertes in a country for a single eu-weit recognised method. </seg>
<seg id=1501> The effects of smoking on health are now widely recognised, and legislators and public are already come to the conclusion that it is time, strict rules and rules on this product to adopt. </seg>
<seg id=1502> The Community legislation will for this reason, very well in the future add international rules and, therefore, the risk of the creation of barriers to prevent, at the same time, strengthen consumer protection and a high level of public health guarantee. </seg>
<seg id=1503> It would be dealt with before the whole question of additives in the first report deals with the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1504> With regard to laboratory testing is the amendment on the approval of tests superfluous, because in a different article stipulates that only these were in transport must be brought to the provisions of the directive meet. </seg>
<seg id=1505> Madam President, this report is very clear: at the moment is the duration of directives on summer-time to just five years limited, then they must Parliament once again to extend be presented. </seg>
<seg id=1506> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer-time arrangements which we are examining, seems to me to be a good proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1507> I therefore believe that we in this House with this issue the not too long should stop, but the Member States and the population of the summer-time arrangements already widely accepted, and it is as part of this year rhythm recognised. </seg>
<seg id=1508> I am in favour of the questions regarding the time zones and the harmonisation of summer time arrangements, as proposed in the decision-making powers of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1509> It contest more in favour of summer time at the end of September, some six months after its beginning to end. </seg>
<seg id=1510> We are in favour of appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the 2007 to be report, as in Article 5 mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=1511> It is clear that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted. </seg>
<seg id=1512> We will, if we accept this compromise, still have a system which guarantees the therapeutic progress and the protection of patients in Europe not only in this way can we, as it is, but improved, and that is why I call for this compromise. </seg>
<seg id=1513> These groups must continue to fall within the scope of the directive. </seg>
<seg id=1514> I am pleased, however, that it is here that we have succeeded in the bud railways treatment put a stop to. </seg>
<seg id=1515> I would like the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his report and congratulate him for his efforts to achieve a compromise in view of the differences thank. </seg>
<seg id=1516> These programmes are the cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and the promotion. Their breakdown would the end of relevant plans and the work of the networks created mean. </seg>
<seg id=1517> It is extremely favourable, the ground in advance to put in order to proceed as quickly as possible and, even if a second reading is needed, as far as possible to approach the point where a decision can be taken. </seg>
<seg id=1518> Furthermore, we must bear in mind that both the prevention and promotion and the monitoring are becoming increasingly important, and that is why you must accord greater importance and a higher budget set aside for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id=1519> Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the current European action programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction to express, in which the European policy in the field of public health are concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1520> I understand that the Council indicated be agreement in principle. </seg>
<seg id=1521> In the European Union are now in a paradoxical situation that the internal borders for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital have been abolished, the 15 borders but to continue in the fields of police and justice are maintained in criminal matters. Their removal of the Member States more difficult. </seg>
<seg id=1522> Finally, remains that the initiative a real and important step forward in the creation of a European criminal law area. If you only covers areas and in its impact is limited, it is to the real needs of many European citizens, which until now virtually powerless as were, if you outside the territory of their country of residence of the victim of a crime has been. </seg>
<seg id=1523> What we have for these people called for? </seg>
<seg id=1524> At the same time, to ensure that the experts, the direct contact with the victims, to carry out a specific training received. </seg>
<seg id=1525> Victims must not twice victims, only victims of crime and then of the system. </seg>
<seg id=1526> In this context, it is also important that the members of the family of the victim, discreetly and professional on the issue to be informed and, if requested, with the necessary support, and that they should not everything in the newspapers. </seg>
<seg id=1527> This applies irrespective of the type of crime. </seg>
<seg id=1528> We must at either national or eu-ebene ever departure from the principle that an individual always the responsibility for its own actions should have to pay. </seg>
<seg id=1529> In other cases, it could be required, the necessary information to obtain in a language of the Union, which is not their own is. </seg>
<seg id=1530> I am pleased with the favourable reaction of Parliament to the first text on such an important issue, so that the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building our fellow citizens protection in situations with which we often only with difficulty rightly. </seg>
<seg id=1531> Vote on request for urgent procedure </seg>
<seg id=1532> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure) </seg>
<seg id=1533> We have in the night of 23 to 24 November reached agreement with the Council on the basis of a budget, which is certainly not in splendour, but is perfectly reasonable. </seg>
<seg id=1534> The Commission was therefore a revision proposed in order to EUR 300 million. The Council has tooth and nail against opposed. </seg>
<seg id=1535> But I also know from conversations that it is much more difficult to formulate a tradeable Council position, to obtain a mandate and the puren national egotism in a reasonably sensible and reasonable to lead pan-European decision. </seg>
<seg id=1536> I hope that the work for a common Office recruitment, as it is called, in other words a European attitude authority, really make progress, so that we the problems in the next few years to all the institutions to play, on the Council as well as the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions, namely, the staff of the next few years, to deal with together. </seg>
<seg id=1537> The Council denied this revision - now we should already on the data - and I would like to him a warning: the flexibility instrument in two consecutive years, in fact less than 15 months and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspective, to make use of the flexibility instrument weaken financially, because it prevents its restoration and possible cumulation, which up to EUR 600 million is planned. </seg>
<seg id=1538> This considerable amount of money, which needs to be high in 2001 is due, in particular, by the use of the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 200 million to be financed. </seg>
<seg id=1539> In the light of this new situation, the Council has adopted at second reading a budget that an increase of 2.5 % growth. </seg>
<seg id=1540> Before this budget finally adopted, I would like to stress the value of the Council to the observance of some basic budgetary rules concerning the sums in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure does. </seg>
<seg id=1541> And contrary to Nice, I believe that all three institutions - europÃ¤isches Parliament, the Council and the Commission, with the result in the right balance satisfied. </seg>
<seg id=1542> Ladies and gentlemen, the recent discovery of cattle bse-erkrankten also made of the budgetary need immediate action, namely the protection of public health, consumer protection, but also in the aid to the farmers affected by this situation. </seg>
<seg id=1543> In addition, the Council has for the framework programme to support the reconstruction in the Western Balkans set a more year amount, which is only a guideline is, however, with the financial perspective in line. </seg>
<seg id=1544> With are and wÃ¼rgen we still have a few million euros more out beaten. </seg>
<seg id=1545> My sincere thanks to Mrs Haug. </seg>
<seg id=1546> Think they therefore remember that this 1 % of the European Union budget used is very good. </seg>
<seg id=1547> If I have understood correctly, then you said that the reserve we must not use, because it breaks the rules. </seg>
<seg id=1548> I therefore think that we have, as well as many other, which I now because of the short time cannot say, very good things seen. </seg>
<seg id=1549> While the agricultural expenditure, the almost make up half of the entire budget, taking into account of the letter of amendment in the coming year, over 5 % growth is the growth of the entire budget only 3.5 %. </seg>
<seg id=1550> We now see a great risk that in the next few years confrontation between the Meda, mittelmeeranrainerstaat-projekten and Balkans will increase, although we all know that that is where money is urgently needed. </seg>
<seg id=1551> Pleased that the difficulties have been overcome, which is on the way to the desired objective, auftÃ¼rmten in Helsinki with the applicant countries to fulfil commitments, without to fall outside the Union, and the future of Europe in the state to allow to continue to act effectively. </seg>
<seg id=1552> But it progress has been made real progress, even if it does not go as far as the presidency - which, as I would like to say national seen a great openness has shown - would have liked. </seg>
<seg id=1553> For the statute of the European parties is provided for a new legal basis, and Parliament to be given the right to take action in accordance with Article 230 of the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1554> In the last few months are three important steps forward have been done. </seg>
<seg id=1555> This is the aim of the in in this respect Nice declaration and the deliberations, so that the fight against doping at European level to coordinate. </seg>
<seg id=1556> On the environmental risks heard - as is well known - the global warming. </seg>
<seg id=1557> In Nice, the European Union continues to the for the identification and management of a common foreign and security policy used necessary permanent bodies: a political and sicherheitspolisches Committee, a military Committee and the European military staff. </seg>
<seg id=1558> For this cooperation, for their support and also for the reception given us would like to thank you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency. </seg>
<seg id=1559> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1560> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1561> We now have the text in Parliament consider carefully. </seg>
<seg id=1562> I way in passing to point out, Mr President of the European Council that the costs borne by the taxpayer. </seg>
<seg id=1563> I regard it as a failure not only in terms of the European Union' s declared ambition to change the institutions and the efficiency of the European Union, so that the new members to incorporate properly, but also in relation to another important objective that perhaps too little has been pointed out, in relation to the approximation of the European Union and the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1564> The right questions are, in our view, those who the impressive poorest people deal, on the eve of the summit from the whole of Europe in Nice zusammengestrÃ¶mt was. </seg>
<seg id=1565> First, the fifteen haste in an atmosphere trÃ¤nengasgeschwÃ¤ngerten the grundrechtecharte signed. </seg>
<seg id=1566> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1567> My group is disappointed that Treaty and on the future, which he is concerned. That is why we are all in its power to fight against. </seg>
<seg id=1568> Mr President, you have the floor. </seg>
<seg id=1569> Finally, I would like answers Mr Hager, that the instrument of strengthened cooperation in my opinion, it is useful to make Europe more dynamic and to make the path to explore how it earlier - I believe - Romano Prodi has said. For my part, I am in favour of this fully. </seg>
<seg id=1570> Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament for the summer time a new achievement after Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1571> The so far by the complexity of the clinical trials abgeschreckten pharmaceutical companies may by the of the states, as well as our Parliament clearly expressed will encourage the market to develop for paediatric medicines, even if this does not large enough to the profitability of investments secure. </seg>
<seg id=1572> (FR) Is the summer-time regime, which at the time of the oil crisis for reasons of imported energy saving and until 2001 was extended to continue? </seg>
<seg id=1573> Is not always the standing of victims in criminal proceedings protected effectively. </seg>
<seg id=1574> This European initiative is therefore a large number of passengers and holidaymakers benefit. </seg>
<seg id=1575> Mr President, first of all I should like to greet the Commission President Prodi, who is here with us, as well as the presidency, which is the Chamber accession, and emphasise that in this House probably never such unanimity in the evaluation of the results of a summit has shown. </seg>
<seg id=1576> The Europe that is moving forward, is that which under the French Presidency in six months, as it seems to me, despite all its work in six key areas has done. </seg>
<seg id=1577> Above all, however, I fear that the United Kingdom, France and Germany now will be able, in the course of decades between Member States of different sizes and between the institutions reached delicate balance to be upset. </seg>
<seg id=1578> It is difficult to see how the decisions of Nice, in fact, the enlargement of the Eu easier. </seg>
<seg id=1579> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today I can be very brief. </seg>
<seg id=1580> For all of this I can only draw the consequences that I if, on the Treaty of Nice should be voted ' no ' will vote. </seg>
<seg id=1581> Mr President, the most important outcome of Nice was that, in spite of everything, an agreement has been reached and now place for the candidate countries can be created. </seg>
<seg id=1582> The real winners of this conference are the Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, the gentlemen who say ' no ' to Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1583> So we forget Nice and we are on our blicke post Nice. Allow me, I hope to the of Belgium for its Presidency announced projects to put a great Convention, since it has been demonstrated that we must go new ways, we need a new method, we must speed up the history, because 2004 is too late, is in too distant future, leads to many risks. </seg>
<seg id=1584> Instead, there was the spirit of Nice obviously it is to questions, how can we block, how can we intergouvernementalisieren, how can we therefore House as a defender of the national interests of celebration, instead, to ensure the European Union really forward. </seg>
<seg id=1585> What we after Amsterdam and Nice is a Europe of imperial potentates, a Europe of the national administrations and not the Europe of the political agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1586> On the essential issues, we can no longer to qualified majority voting abandon. </seg>
<seg id=1587> It is true that, I am here to the words of Mr Bayrou, I have this morning here Sitze, first on the side of the President of the Republic, now in a personal capacity and on all sides we have criticisms, moderate, friendly criticism, as it seems to me, but in any case, criticisms. </seg>
<seg id=1588> We must not forget that it is in fact the first time since 1957 is that this scheme really reformed or restructured. </seg>
<seg id=1589> We have to do constitutional systems, and can therefore the powers cannot be mixed. </seg>
<seg id=1590> Thank you, Minister. </seg>
<seg id=1591> But it is not included in the Treaties have been, yet there is a reference to the Charter in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1592> Finally, were mentioned some positive aspects, such as the revision of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties, and the statute, the right of Parliament, the other institutions to the Court of justice against - an important factor of political control - the new formula for the European Commission, the inclusion of the so-called ' lex Prodi " in the Treaty, the strengthening of the President and the new composition of the Commission. All this is a reasonable compromise, which I accept and the certainly prove. </seg>
<seg id=1593> Mr President, we already have a clear evaluation of what has happened in Nice, made. </seg>
<seg id=1594> If we look at things: the Charter has not been in the Treaty included, not even a reference. </seg>
<seg id=1595> We want the government to show that we are better able to. </seg>
<seg id=1596> Despite the board praise the French presidency this morning is not the IGC to a successful conclusion. </seg>
<seg id=1597> Mr President, it is not so easy, now to criticise the French Presidency, since he is not here. </seg>
<seg id=1598> Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model no longer the Intergovernmental Conference. </seg>
<seg id=1599> 2001 budget (continuation) </seg>
<seg id=1600> This does not mean, however, we would not have more and some not too can do better. </seg>
<seg id=1601> By such ceilings, the Commission will be forced, within the framework of a limited budget to set priorities, as any authority must do. </seg>
<seg id=1602> With the vote following on this debate is a long and difficult process of decision-making on the European Union budget for the year 2001 to the end. </seg>
<seg id=1603> That is why we are as follows approach: by recourse to Article 272 we have avoided a budgetary crisis. The financial perspective has been in spite of use of the flexibility instrument maintained. </seg>
<seg id=1604> Directed at the Council, I would like to say that we are not in this game as soon start the balls and that we will play until we achieved the desired result. </seg>
<seg id=1605> We do not want the resolution Colom already a revised proposal contains for the coming year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the world Bank, but we parts of his criticism that a solution with regard to the financial under provision of heading 4 in this way the multiannual nature of the major objectives of the external action of the Union and the definition of the financial perspective distorted. </seg>
<seg id=1606> In order to achieve all of this, for our long-term commitments to fulfil, must in future priorities. </seg>
<seg id=1607> Only in this way is the money that we for our fellow citizens available, sensible and properly spent. </seg>
<seg id=1608> If we expected to provide supplementary budget, then it will be in almost 8 %, while we in all other areas, it is education policy, it is the whole area of internal policy, including research, foreign policy, the administration of pre-accession aid, a total of only a growth rate of 1.1 %. </seg>
<seg id=1609> As the cooperation is so well, we will, of course, then in the supplementary budget in January have the opportunity to continue. </seg>
<seg id=1610> We also welcome it if the still not regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic states criticism. </seg>
<seg id=1611> We take interest in the social and internal developments in Russia. </seg>
<seg id=1612> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1613> Even though President Putin to us the democratic development guarantee of his country, he is not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russia. Nor is the democratic system of government not living reality in Russia. </seg>
<seg id=1614> But we should not secretly do, but it is a Europe of economic cooperation to build. </seg>
<seg id=1615> As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr van Orden absolutely right. </seg>
<seg id=1616> Who Russia from the outside, and then up to also direct impressions of the country itself and Russian partners get quickly is in danger of selective the reality of the country to explain what it is in be Russia image does. </seg>
<seg id=1617> In the political field, the common Russia strategy, policy on a permanent dialogue and security and in favour of a permanent mechanism to create. </seg>
<seg id=1618> I would like to stress that we really must make it clear that Russia is indeed a political union with Belarus is. </seg>
<seg id=1619> Are you, Mr Patten, prepared to such a project to support? </seg>
<seg id=1620> As the honourable Members know, was at the last summit between the European Union and Russia of Romano Prodi a wide-ranging dialogue on issues of energy set in motion. </seg>
<seg id=1621> I very much hope that I at the beginning of next year will be an opportunity, even Kaliningrad to visit, not only because Immanuel Kant be a whole life there has spent. </seg>
<seg id=1622> I congratulate the honourable Member once again on an excellent report on a very important subject, which we in the years to come here in Parliament certainly turn to be repeated. </seg>
<seg id=1623> You place me in a difficult position. </seg>
<seg id=1624> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very necessary, because the bse-krise has huge implications for feed, on production and imports of feedingstuffs. </seg>
<seg id=1625> The Council has at its many meetings with Russia at all levels its concern expressed in particular to the Russian government to persuade excessive use of force and a possible extension to avoid the conflict, independent and effective investigations to be carried out of the violations of human rights, the support group of osze in fulfilling its mission to provide aid and, finally, with regard to the transport of humanitarian aid to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=1626> Mr President, on a point of order: it is actually customary in the House that issues, the oral not enough can be answered in writing, after does. </seg>
<seg id=1627> (interruption from Mr Posselt) </seg>
<seg id=1628> This directive dates from 1992. </seg>
<seg id=1629> And in this sense, we have to work. </seg>
<seg id=1630> These groups are not, however, seem to be in the new proposal been included. </seg>
<seg id=1631> The Presidency and some Member States have the association of the European sugar industry several letter to maintain the Commission' s proposal in its deliberations will be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id=1632> Question no 6 by (H-0886/00): </seg>
<seg id=1633> As a first of all, I must say that the President-in-Office of the Council, in my opinion, the question by Mr Korakas has not yet addressed. </seg>
<seg id=1634> Now it is setting up this authority, and I believe that the European authorities of the problem very well aware of, and that we need to make progress. </seg>
<seg id=1635> To put it in a nutshell, is the representative of the presidency, in this case, the French ambassador in Algeria, with Mr M. Ahmed taleb met? </seg>
<seg id=1636> We welcome in this context of the preparation of committee proposed and adopted by the general Assembly provisions for the accreditation of non-governmental organisations on the preparation process and on the special session in September 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1637> The text on the accession partnership includes a number of references to the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. </seg>
<seg id=1638> As the Council to the Members have already pointed out in his last answer, the process of mutual recognition of decisions taken in criminal matters better protection of the rights of persons allow. </seg>
<seg id=1639> However, I would like to follow this up. </seg>
<seg id=1640> It will, in particular, the political control and the strategic leadership of military action to crisis management. </seg>
<seg id=1641> I would just like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxes, the harmonisation for the establishment and the funktionieren of the internal market is necessary - as it says in Article 93 - and the approximation, in accordance with Article 94, of legislation, which is directly linked to the establishment and the impact of the common market funktionieren, and this includes the direct taxes. </seg>
<seg id=1642> I would like to a few words about those three key areas say. </seg>
<seg id=1643> If the rules of behaviour that the doubt everybody against everybody else, there is, this could the stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the based on regional cooperation, fall outside. </seg>
<seg id=1644> Ultimately, we also need the cooperation with Yugoslavia, and it is true that mutual cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=1645> Mr President, our group supports the work carried out by Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia. </seg>
<seg id=1646> Mr President, over the years in which I President of the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was, I had the opportunity to many Croats in its efforts to support freedom and prosperity which they, like other peoples of our continent, with its integration into the European institutions the same set. </seg>
<seg id=1647> On the basis of the development of Croatia in this year, I am convinced that we should be able to present a straffes pace, precisely because that Croatia has in recent months done. </seg>
<seg id=1648> In any case, this is the approach we have followed, and the speed with which we in the past few months on the development have stopped in Croatia, confirmed this. </seg>
<seg id=1649> We are the people guilty in Croatia that we you and your government in the coming years fully support, and we are the honourable Member very grateful that he recommends that the path to continue. </seg>
<seg id=1650> In this context, it is incomprehensible that, in the spring of this year, thousands of supporters of the Laskar Jihad to have been able to draw the Moluccas, in order that the fan the flames of conflict. </seg>
<seg id=1651> To deny Timor militias the refugees to return and be workers threatened. </seg>
<seg id=1652> On behalf of the Committee on industry, external trade, research and energy, I would just like to comment on three points. </seg>
<seg id=1653> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by Mrs Maij-Weggen Â­ on their excellent work. </seg>
<seg id=1654> In this respect, there is no exception to that rule. </seg>
<seg id=1655> Continuing violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya bring great suffering on the population. </seg>
<seg id=1656> Here tomorrow will the formal presentation of the Sakharov Prize to take place. </seg>
<seg id=1657> As a result of recent reports from the Indonesian archipelago is, however, the question of whether the situation is even more serious for President Wahid and its supporters even is still precarious, as the rapporteur explained. </seg>
<seg id=1658> If we Indonesia want to help, we must now do money and action. Words alone are not enough. </seg>
<seg id=1659> In my view, is the report before us in this important point information work. </seg>
<seg id=1660> It is obvious that the difficulties of the country not overnight overcome. </seg>
<seg id=1661> Protection of the communities ' financial interests </seg>
<seg id=1662> The obstacles to its independent work, particularly in the staff recruitment and in its building structured, must finally be removed. </seg>
<seg id=1663> The Commission must, therefore, by means of an internal reform process finally ensure your announcement that fraud will not be tolerated and every fraud consistently. </seg>
<seg id=1664> I think that this is what must in fact be the consequence, also of Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1665> We welcome negotiations between the Member States on the approximation of legislation in the field of crime, but we would like to our countries no federal eu-anklagebehÃ¶rde subject. </seg>
<seg id=1666> In addition, I would like to know why the publication of the Commission document on this issue until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro was delayed. </seg>
<seg id=1667> I have asked for these countries the naming of, because I believe it is time to you to accuse. </seg>
<seg id=1668> In fact I am sure that Olaf is interested in the selection of more transparent management to make. </seg>
<seg id=1669> We must ensure, however, that when we all concentration on the problems of the Commission is not our own, after all, but right overlook considerable problems. We also have problems. </seg>
<seg id=1670> We are trying to extinguish the fire and stifle most smoke. </seg>
<seg id=1671> Nobody can understand that, I do not. </seg>
<seg id=1672> In order to achieve this aim in every respect, I would like to respond to four questions which, in my view, a prominent role in the work of the authority on budgetary control authority to play. </seg>
<seg id=1673> For Parliament itself is the problem in the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1674> It is true alarming if the Commission, Commissioner, as guardian of the Treaties on respect for the rights of the Members explicitly must be made. </seg>
<seg id=1675> He has the opportunity, for a certain period of time no funds on instructions relating to authorise the in question budget lines, particularly those on the increase in the appropriations allocated in the budget aimed, until further investigations are complete. It could even call on the President of the Commission, to demand the resignation of the Commission, in the context of serious problems have been established, a sort of eu-kaiserschnitt. </seg>
<seg id=1676> The report calls for detailed inventory of the operational activities, thorough checks of budget lines and irregularities and Commission internal evaluation of performance. </seg>
<seg id=1677> Commissioner, the starting point of the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the eg-vertrag and not the interinstitutional agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1678> The result of this common position but it would be, if it is not changed would that we at the end of the day, not only in relation to North America do not have a level playing field, but not even within Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1679> I would not, why there should not be able, as in all the other directives have been able, at the end of a compromise. </seg>
<seg id=1680> It is a proposal which a long and, I fear, stormy journey has, with some of the difficulties to be overcome. </seg>
<seg id=1681> The first amendment relates to Article 4, in which the issue of the competent authority for the supply will be regulated. </seg>
<seg id=1682> On the other hand, would the proposal before us now confusion and a search for the best each court state and potential Rechtsstreite to a during the adoption of a company law sensitive time cause. </seg>
<seg id=1683> In the United Kingdom has in takeovers by the adoption committee' s voluntary code of conduct excellent. It is a good example of how, with a very complex issue, for a regulation does not so good, pragmatic be handled. </seg>
<seg id=1684> Far more important, however, is that we should be able to the formulated in Lisbon task of creating a competitive, dynamic European economy forward. </seg>
<seg id=1685> It is for us here in the European Parliament, in the final analysis, therefore, the major tension fields in takeovers law, for example board versus shareholders, major shareholders versus small, companies versus capital market, in a European Mindestform rules. </seg>
<seg id=1686> Through a number of amendments proposed by Parliament, the text of the common position of the Council rectified by on the points to interpretation difficulties could lead to out and a more rapid implementation of the directive is called for. </seg>
<seg id=1687> It is not at all clear that the proposed definition of a reasonable price is better than another, because the various currently in force in the Member States definitions are all quite clear. </seg>
<seg id=1688> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=1689> Furthermore, the artists a information right, granted his rights within a period of up to three years in a professional art dealers to find out what is appropriate, because it on the purchase and sale of books need to have. </seg>
<seg id=1690> Consequently, there is a need for the Austrian legislators and not the attack European legislators, the only for artists and auction houses positive framework creates. </seg>
<seg id=1691> Furthermore, on the subject we are dealing with, the need for a common position, are all the greater because only such a made it possible for the European Union, at international level strongly to ensure that the interests of artists in the world to be protected. </seg>
<seg id=1692> I trust in the wisdom and the Weitsichtigkeit this House. </seg>
<seg id=1693> So benefited 1998 in Germany only 274 of 7 000 artists, which have transferred their rights, the resale right, and 40 % of the amount to Erhebungs- and administrative costs account. </seg>
<seg id=1694> In short, there is no need for harmonisation in this area. </seg>
<seg id=1695> A similar amendment has already, at first reading, rejected. </seg>
<seg id=1696> It is assumed that the translations despite this right gedrÃ¤ngten and after is difficult timetable could be. </seg>
<seg id=1697> We are only now as far as that we unfortunately no longer postpone. </seg>
<seg id=1698> We have proposed in committee, this is a year earlier to do. </seg>
<seg id=1699> Of course, support this Parliament these values and it will continue to defend. </seg>
<seg id=1700> As a result of the technological developments and the modified markets will inevitably a change to take place. </seg>
<seg id=1701> As we can find no right reason for competition to be avoided. </seg>
<seg id=1702> The reduction of the core of the postal sector, in other words, the universal service, on the transport of mail to a weight of 50 G would for the national postal operators seriously create the risk, no universal service at a reasonable price for the entire population in all regions more able to guarantee. </seg>
<seg id=1703> I should like my colleagues in the conservatives in this House out of the mess that you in the United Kingdom, anrichteten as you privatise the British post office wanted. </seg>
<seg id=1704> From the safety net for the postal services we have a hÃ¤ngematte to these large companies made of the postal services, in the rest and continue to do so, as you still permitted. </seg>
<seg id=1705> I am very pleased with this result, because it with the concept of special services the new technologies in the field of universal service exclude wanted. </seg>
<seg id=1706> Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, we cannot and will not tolerate this. </seg>
<seg id=1707> The European Commission is proposing, therefore, for the second stage not the full liberalisation of the postal services. </seg>
<seg id=1708> Such a future I would like to for other countries of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1709> Mr Bolkestein has recently in the Dutch press for the French an illiberal position, there was at least a newspaper article calls. </seg>
<seg id=1710> On this could Spain say something that such a fund set up and has taken, that is to say it could be the uncertain legal bases of the funds, to the virtual criteria its composition and the discretion decisions on its application speak. </seg>
<seg id=1711> We shall be voting tomorrow, I hope, for the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins and Mr Sterckx, because otherwise I would led me, against the report before us to vote. </seg>
<seg id=1712> Royal mail is involved in this competition and distributed my letters in MalmÃ¶, Sweden. </seg>
<seg id=1713> What we have from the debate, or rather learnt from the controversy, the Commissioner Bolkestein with its follow-up to the liberalisation of the postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in violation of the rules laid down in this directive has caused? We have learned that, under the guise progressive and aufwertender concepts, such as modernisation, liberalisation or support of technological recovery - the reduction of social quality hide a country. </seg>
<seg id=1714> The proposed protection of universal service by setting up a compensation fund, on the private operators contributions to the financing of the universal service obligations of the postal service providers in remote areas will do not think there was. </seg>
<seg id=1715> These shortcomings and this delay have also contributed to that in the debate purpose and funds often confuse. </seg>
<seg id=1716> Madam President, in the treatment of this matter we are talking about the economic and social cohesion. </seg>
<seg id=1717> Madam President, allow me as a first of all, the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to congratulate, because it is, of course, a delicate, difficult work carried out, in which he has had to try to the balance between completely different proposals, attitudes and source and objective points to be found. </seg>
<seg id=1718> I fear that the result will be that the current monopolies its position at the taxpayers ' expense further consolidate and the benchmark for new ones something set higher. </seg>
<seg id=1719> I am pleased that our Liberal party members from the other European countries the position of the British Liberals support. </seg>
<seg id=1720> I believe that the liberalisation of for desirable and welcome the advantages for consumers, and the resulting. </seg>
<seg id=1721> Justified because it is in the logic of the Treaties which the European Union, the completion of the internal market with the free movement of goods and services in the context of competition certain priority. </seg>
<seg id=1722> The provision of this type of service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area, and all our activities are to improve this service geared. </seg>
<seg id=1723> The special services are another important area in which promote innovation and the modernisation must be advanced. </seg>
<seg id=1724> He also said that he is the opening up of virtually the whole of the postal market by the end of this decade for inevitable. </seg>
<seg id=1725> I want to ensure that the obligation to provide a universal service enshrined indisputable and in the future too be guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id=1726> For this reason, and I will not stand idly by while the future of this sector is at stake, because we the tasks which all of us in Lisbon transfer have not been properly fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id=1727> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson. </seg>
<seg id=1728> I would remind you that the main objective of the common organisation of the market is, their products a guaranteed access to the Community market to ensure. </seg>
<seg id=1729> Fortunately we have been able to in the Committee on agriculture in the end to achieve unanimity. I thank my colleagues and Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on development and cooperation, for your support. </seg>
<seg id=1730> For example, we must continue our concern about the banana production in certain akp-lÃ¤ndern, in the small countries of the West Indies and in some West African countries, to express the traditional suppliers are on the banana market and to whom we have obligations, which we must not forget. </seg>
<seg id=1731> I would therefore ask that this report in its entirety, as well as the Committee on agriculture and rural development, of the Members of this Parliament will be supported. </seg>
<seg id=1732> Of the usa were originally the historical reference periods have been rejected, in the meantime, however, is a solution with its own historical reference time areas in favour. </seg>
<seg id=1733> Strong interests, in particular the Americans, who themselves are not banana growers, but the American capital invested in the businesses, a role to play. </seg>
<seg id=1734> Sometimes, it seems as if the Commission' s proposals on the deregulation of trade and of agricultural production in the international level even further away than the Cairns group. </seg>
<seg id=1735> Unfortunately persist Commission and the Council on a solution which this production can seriously threaten, especially after 2006. </seg>
<seg id=1736> In the various wto-entscheidungen it does not mean that we our traditional countries not preferences give must. </seg>
<seg id=1737> The transitional period should therefore around fifteen years, at least but ten years. Must also a compensatory income support for producers and the paragraph of production in the outermost regions include, which therefore also a includes aid for the institutions, which are produced banana market. </seg>
<seg id=1738> I hope that it is now our arguments, because the system proposed by the Commission of the tariff preferences, even if it is to be set EUR 300, could in fact as quite prove ineffective, as the akp-erzeuger by the so-called ausgebremst wind dog procedure. </seg>
<seg id=1739> Votes </seg>
<seg id=1740> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) </seg>
<seg id=1741> The Commission is unable to accept the other amendments. </seg>
<seg id=1742> Before the vote: </seg>
<seg id=1743> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment) </seg>
<seg id=1744> Report by (A5-0383/2000) Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on budgetary control, on the reform of the budget control and, Instanzen (2000/2008(INI)) </seg>
<seg id=1745> The most smokers are neither on the full risk still on the consequences of their activities in mind. </seg>
<seg id=1746> Point I have in my long parliamentary life of now 35 years always kept. </seg>
<seg id=1747> I fear, however, that this hope in vain. </seg>
<seg id=1748> This is our last attempt, by means of labels and photographs on the packets the actual consequences of smoking to clarify. </seg>
<seg id=1749> Report Lehne (A5-0368/2000) </seg>
<seg id=1750> This is a view I still believe is relevant and correct. Consequently, I have voted against the report in its entirety. </seg>
<seg id=1751> The Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market is absolutely right when he refers to the rejection of the ceiling and insistence on a minimum, not under 7 % must. </seg>
<seg id=1752> With your vote against this directive would like to my group is also a political respect signal in this respect, as we in the European Union, not in order to stop must, to unnecessary regulations. </seg>
<seg id=1753> Of course, the former Stalinist dictatorship be condemned, but how can we Mr Putin even the slightest confidence, this executioners of the Chechen people, this protest various mafia, the head of State, the any opposition and civil society (trade unions and political parties would like to eliminate), for its own power to strengthen? </seg>
<seg id=1754> Would actually Indonesia such an intensification of relations not deserve particular, since in the last few years, the leaders of that country, not just with a high level of democracy or to great merits excellent, but we must also the Indonesian citizens have in mind, which is why we this intensification of relations and this aid welcome. </seg>
<seg id=1755> This unit must only deal with criminal acts by eu-beschÃ¤ftigten have been committed. </seg>
<seg id=1756> (FR) The Theato report on the fight against fraud will enable us to say that the European Central Bank, certainly for the better proof of its famous independence, accession to the agreement on the European Anti-Fraud office (Olaf) not for appropriate. </seg>
<seg id=1757> That concludes the vote. </seg>
<seg id=1758> We have to recognise that there are only two possibilities: either we are part of this, or we do not belong to it. </seg>
<seg id=1759> Ladies and gentlemen, it gives us no cause for a name change. </seg>
<seg id=1760> The mere customs system, however, is an important element in the balance of the Commission proposal is and that an important basis for this is, in order to be at all able to make progress in the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1761> Measures for the marketing of these bananas are also in the national and regional programmes to promote the development of rural areas. </seg>
<seg id=1762> Europe and the United States are working in defence of our common values closely together. </seg>
<seg id=1763> We will probably also on a new wto-runde and on the effects of the many new bilateral trade initiatives in this wto-runde, are talking about the currently being discussed in the American hemisphere. </seg>
<seg id=1764> He pointed out that the transatlantic relationship in the last ten years has been considerably extended, and this on the American side, in particular, the efforts of President Clinton is due to. I think, however, that in the history books one day also be noted that these new relations Europe with the transatlantic declaration of 1990 and the new transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995 an important contribution to the success of this crucial part relations had. </seg>
<seg id=1765> Therefore, it is important that a transition to make and indeed a transatlantische agenda for the year 2001 letter. </seg>
<seg id=1766> I would like to conclude by the statement made by representatives of the Dominican Republic quote: " the wto was originally an impartial Schiedsstelle be to ensure that the common rules are complied with and that the countries with the free trade familiar. </seg>
<seg id=1767> Secondly, we can agree on welcome the decline of the Communist sham, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union is only one superpower left, namely the usa. </seg>
<seg id=1768> I know that he a successful and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the other committees, which involved in these issues. </seg>
<seg id=1769> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: </seg>
<seg id=1770> These objectives, the main objective and the secondary objectives, will be the test, with the proposals put forward by the Commission specific must be assessed. </seg>
<seg id=1771> As you know, could such a solution, set up in one country, with the possibility of the provision of services throughout the Union - an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation cause. </seg>
<seg id=1772> They do was allowed to the standard rate of 15 % not fall below, but given the Member States the right to one or more rates of not less than 5 % to apply, and, in this instance, it is now planned derogations. </seg>
<seg id=1773> We called on the European Commission to monitor to ensure that no distortion of the report and that the Council and Parliament be informed. </seg>
<seg id=1774> In short, the aim of this proposal is true, but the method is wrong designed, and if we really electronic economy of Europe want to support, it would be a VAT exemption our own e companies and not the attempt to our problems to be transferred to other, the right signal. </seg>
<seg id=1775> To the demands for a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases to be able to fulfil, we must all possible measures to limit their take. </seg>
<seg id=1776> The only case where not yet tax levied is the if from a third country in the European Community will be delivered. </seg>
<seg id=1777> Positive discrimination of air transport must be brought to an end. </seg>
<seg id=1778> Companies from third countries, on the other hand, will not be taxed. </seg>
<seg id=1779> Cds are not very altertÃ¼mlich, but should, however, be taxed, while on the Internet available programmes to be exempt from tax should. </seg>
<seg id=1780> However, should the solution proposed as not technically feasible and as a barrier to the development of the Internet transactions to be in the European Union, even though all the expansion of existence tendons. </seg>
<seg id=1781> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union will be toothless and will lose concentration. </seg>
<seg id=1782> We should consider how we electronic commerce can promote and we have no new methods thought to how we him tax. </seg>
<seg id=1783> The Liberal represent the principle of " as little state as possible ', and the usa as an example. </seg>
<seg id=1784> The Primarolo group has drawn up simple rules which must be implemented. </seg>
<seg id=1785> As objection is the I represent in this Parliament group believes that the should be corrected fact that the press normally benefit from come reduced rates of VAT, whereas the reduction in the digital newspapers is not applied. </seg>
<seg id=1786> A tax on kerosene it can therefore only in the international consensus to be a level playing field to guarantee. </seg>
<seg id=1787> I particularly welcome the fact that the report is one of the most important of me in my report for the Committee on transport and tourism has underpinned taken by this Parliament advocated a few months ago, and that we, as long as there is no doubt politically difficult to an international agreement on the taxation of aviation fuel, at least in the short term Alternative instruments should look at, in order to achieve the same effect, including a emissions tax. </seg>
<seg id=1788> Indeed, the industry to 100 % by flight secure taxes and charges for their infrastructure costs to the 1998 to us USD 4 billion, - in contrast to other modes of transport as for example rail and road transport, which is still heavily subsidised. </seg>
<seg id=1789> The present situation is bad. </seg>
<seg id=1790> In this context it has to be said that there is a problem in the emissions from aviation, even if the in percentage terms is not so great, but it is growing very strongly, and that is why we should it not talk down. </seg>
<seg id=1791> This plan for the development of the kmu within and outside the Union be harmful, especially in view of the proposed reduction of the threshold value for an exemption from tax on a unacceptable low level of the year turnover of 40 000. </seg>
<seg id=1792> If we are now to be dealt with question beflissen, we jeopardise the really important for Europe future of electronic commerce. </seg>
<seg id=1793> The starting point, which is a providers of services based in a third country, to a customer in the Community, is just one point of to register need must not to a transfer of tax revenues between the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1794> Since the discussion in the Council is still under way and, amongst other things, in the face of the Commission' s attempt to the issue of VAT and electronic commerce in the short term to a successful conclusion, it seems to me at the moment best, the amendments proposed by Parliament have not yet formally to accept, but to try to in the discussions in the Council, as far as possible, through. </seg>
<seg id=1795> I can therefore the proposed amendments not accept. </seg>
<seg id=1796> Thank you very much for having in this week, all these different issues have adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1797> The Commission, for its part, has just three months after the accident recognised its responsibility and a first package of measures adopted by the European Parliament on 30 November fully confirmed. </seg>
<seg id=1798> In fact, it is more than 15 existing directives or regulations urgently necessary to harmonise the practices and greater control of the application of Community standards to be carried out, in order, if necessary, the significant appearance and unacceptable differences in the field of maritime safety in the European Union to prevent. </seg>
<seg id=1799> Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her long-term commitment in the field of maritime safety. </seg>
<seg id=1800> I would like to the ladies and gentlemen remind you that, in the safety of air transport in the European area and in the field of the usa compensation not with the sums used in other countries agree. </seg>
<seg id=1801> Secondly, I would like to say that it is the French courts, which would have the possibility, the means to confiscate a specific society freeze or, to compensation for damage to figures or else, the liability could decide on the beyond the sum which, according to the objective criteria, the current international regulations on pollution from mineral oils is planned. </seg>
<seg id=1802> The Commission is of the opinion that these are steps in the right direction and to create fairer levies systems, which also incentives for a more rational and more effective use of the road network offer. </seg>
<seg id=1803> In the light of the criticism, especially from Ireland and France, there was then to this amendment, and now give the matter by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer a completely new twist: it is now as a consumer levy for all, and therefore also for British lorry drivers, presented. </seg>
<seg id=1804> I am obliged to ensure that the consumers available food, whether they are from the European Union or from outside come highest requirements. </seg>
<seg id=1805> Of course, I understand the concern of the honourable Member. </seg>
<seg id=1806> Commissioner, I regret to say that I your answer is not enough. </seg>
<seg id=1807> The point raised by the honourable Member is very important. </seg>
<seg id=1808> In Nigeria is Chevron of the community of the accused ijaw, on violence against this people angestiftet and even Nigerian soldiers paid to demonstrators on fleets base warri to bomb. </seg>
<seg id=1809> In her on 15 November report was adopted by the Commission to the conclusion that the operating aid under regulation 1540/98 no solution to the problem of the South Korean price practices could be found. </seg>
<seg id=1810> I think that the intentions in their entirety are very reassuring, but the reality is that our shipyards now closed. </seg>
<seg id=1811> Question no 38 by (H-0868/00): </seg>
<seg id=1812> Commissioner, I can understand that their decision not wish to change, although ten Member States such a customs reject. </seg>
<seg id=1813> This initiative is based on a Council regulation amending regulation, which the current aps lays down. </seg>
<seg id=1814> I represent a number of sugar beet growers and am therefore, in fact, very concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1815> This work will take place in the Committee instead, and they had to be this week, as Nielson on a Balkans journey is. </seg>
<seg id=1816> We are working precisely on the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg arguments in favour of the need for discussions with its sugar beet growers, so he can at any time to go. </seg>
<seg id=1817> I would like to Mr Liikanen for a in every respect very positive and constructive answer to thank. </seg>
<seg id=1818> I will discuss this issue with my services, as soon as the question of the budget for the next year is clarified. </seg>
<seg id=1819> My services and myself are currently trying to the geographical distance between the process parties and the consequences resulting future court to limit. </seg>
<seg id=1820> Just as the courts in DÃ¼sseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany specialised in patent law - and there is also such a specialised Court in London - should also a court of the Community, which meets and reaches its decisions cases, the Community patents relating very specialised. </seg>
<seg id=1821> So that such a provisional situation not verstetigt, the Commission has in a letter dated 13 July last year, the Member States concerned reminded of their duty to national Community trade mark courts name. </seg>
<seg id=1822> As the honourable Member knows, this is a complaint einreichen no impact on the progress of the project. </seg>
<seg id=1823> Question no 47 by (H-0877/00): </seg>
<seg id=1824> The Commission will therefore of its available to appeal only in the sense laid down in the regulation make use. </seg>
<seg id=1825> The question is, however, where the students have to address, in order to ensure that the absolvieren this course, and be concluded in Britain you the right to recognition of their studies results gives. </seg>
<seg id=1826> The temporary King could, for example, one of the Finnish verdienstvollsten elected Members of Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1827> The whole can also as a competition issue be regarded as in the southern Baltic, by the wayside Stockholm - Helsinki, the tax free sale is allowed to continue, while he between UmeÃ¥ and Vasa is banned. </seg>
<seg id=1828> We absolutely must this situation by promoting and supporting correct multilingual content, because this for the success of the European content industry is absolutely essential. </seg>
<seg id=1829> I refer in particular to the problem that small businesses investors not always present sufficient guarantees and to refer a sound business development. </seg>
<seg id=1830> With the ambitious project of this European econtent-programms to bring to a successful conclusion, need to simplify the procedures planned and be safeguarded. </seg>
<seg id=1831> That is why we must aim of public support for the Community content industry also be a high level of education and a cultural diversity to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=1832> On the other hand, there are the networks, which are dependent on the content, for their virtual area to fill unstoppable. They, in turn, believe that it is, of course, subject to this content, they buy up and without special account of the production rules be able to use. </seg>
<seg id=1833> Mr President, I welcome this programme econtent very much and would like to make two points out. </seg>
<seg id=1834> I therefore support the amendments which the implementation of specific measures in the field of new technologies is required. </seg>
<seg id=1835> Firstly, the social and cultural role of digital content. Here the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament the social and cultural aspect of digital content stressed. </seg>
<seg id=1836> Assessment and management of environmental noise </seg>
<seg id=1837> In fact, I am grateful that the Christian Democrats, and a part of the Liberal group this a specific amendment by aircraft noise caused already to limit supported. </seg>
<seg id=1838> Now, six years later, and in stetes urge the French government, the Commission has its proposal for European harmonised noise indicators made. </seg>
<seg id=1839> This is a modest proposal. In the Scandinavian countries already stricter standards than for the proposed 2012. </seg>
<seg id=1840> Orly, shiphol, Barcelona and other airports already meet rigorous standards. </seg>
<seg id=1841> Another important point, which we introduced and which is in connection with the problem of aircraft noise will be important, is that, as well as the noise indicators mentioned by the rapporteur further noise indicators should be. </seg>
<seg id=1842> The absence of a common standards in the European Union, it is here to a clear distortion of competition between airports and the ungleichbehandelung of citizens of different Member States have been. </seg>
<seg id=1843> That is why the by my colleague, Bernd long amendments tabled in my opinion, is so important. </seg>
<seg id=1844> Mr President, first of all I must say that I welcome this report. </seg>
<seg id=1845> That was in principle the idea of amendment no 36, although I believe that this idea is not finally thought out. </seg>
<seg id=1846> We should check it very carefully and then on two levels combined approach, limit values for the various sources and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions create. </seg>
<seg id=1847> We need more time, and I regret that we did not have, even if I the framework directive in general support. </seg>
<seg id=1848> Once the Member States have submitted comparable information, the Commission on the issue of the Community limit values and discuss other measures, in order to reduce the noise, and then the Council and Parliament on this report. </seg>
<seg id=1849> Food additives other than colours and sweeteners </seg>
<seg id=1850> These are the three criteria. </seg>
<seg id=1851> Thank you very much, Mr. Me it is similar to that you have a dry mouth, and I have a swelling up in the neck, as we have said, but this is a little the flu. </seg>
<seg id=1852> Chronic food problems also increase the risk of cancer. </seg>
<seg id=1853> At that time, was that the Commission does not have had the right instruments in order to appropriate measures. </seg>
<seg id=1854> Tomorrow is already the next stage in the plan. Then is Mrs Marit Paulsen of the eldr-fraktion in place and has the possibility of the directive still further improvements. </seg>
<seg id=1855> The Member States and the Commission is now a better instrument available, in order to ensure that the rules for animal nutrition are properly enforced and in the event of emergencies in third countries a rapid reagieren is possible. </seg>
<seg id=1856> We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and so far, in particular, these issues harshly treated. </seg>
<seg id=1857> The planning process must be honest and innovative be implemented. </seg>
<seg id=1858> The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable urban development is a suitable instrument for this, and the implementation of agenda 21 is an excellent means of coordination and implementation of actions. </seg>
<seg id=1859> Less transport and the withdrawal from fossil fuels to local level are essential if we a change in the current climate threat want to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=1860> Many have meant that the financial framework to small is. </seg>
<seg id=1861> Key partner in this context should, however, the Commission and the networks of the local authorities, for the preparation and implementation of actions in the field of sustainable urban development legally responsible. </seg>
<seg id=1862> The Court of justice of the communities and even the dispute settlement bodies of the wto are of the opinion that the precautionary principle in the field of the environment, or in the field of public health well be applied to can maintain even against the Europeans, as the current procedure for RohmilchkÃ¤se shows. </seg>
<seg id=1863> Not harm reduction or compensation must be the objective of the ultimate aim must be to damage to health or to property and good of people to prevent. </seg>
<seg id=1864> After all, 1996 was in favour of the European Parliament in accordance with the precautionary principle a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the whole of the European Union, it would have been but only... </seg>
<seg id=1865> Absolute scientific safety on new substances or products are not and will never be. </seg>
<seg id=1866> If the effective and credible precautionary principle should be applied, it is important that all the main players, including representatives of civil society in the political decisions taken within the framework of the application of the principle to be taken in the process. </seg>
<seg id=1867> And finally, the public health and the environment from other considerations, particularly economic, the priority. </seg>
<seg id=1868> The basic precondition for the use of the precautionary principle is that the fear that it could happen harmful consequences, is scientifically justified. </seg>
<seg id=1869> Only yesterday, Professor George Carlo, a Americans, the food and drugs administration in the last seven years, with a study on the effects of radiation on human health has asked, in Lisbon told that there is a risk that the use of mobile phones the incidence of brain cancer, of Alzheimer' s disease and increasing skin damage. </seg>
<seg id=1870> Mr President, the environment and public health as a complicated machine with many functions that we monitor and control in order to Eingreifen able to, so that no harm is done. </seg>
<seg id=1871> In the application of this principle must be prevented at all costs that the innovation and the activities are restricted that restraint and halt in the industry and that in order for competition to being bypassed. </seg>
<seg id=1872> The House will be aware that the Commission with the most in its resolution issues raised in line. </seg>
<seg id=1873> The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m. </seg>
<seg id=1874> In its Article 2 is the right to life confirmed. And whenever the terrorism in Spain human lives, feels the whole of the European Union in one of its fundamental principles violated. </seg>
<seg id=1875> We want the legally established not replace institutions, but they are, our rights and our freedoms to protect, without the terror to give way. </seg>
<seg id=1876> Votes </seg>
<seg id=1877> It has in mind the comments of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the early retirement project in the Commission and the administrative expenditure in connection with the fisheries agreements mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=1878> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) </seg>
<seg id=1879> I believe that this is no longer acceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1880> These are 23428 licences as to see little, you the possibilities offered but welcome. </seg>
<seg id=1881> This extermination, from the middle of last year, effective, led - as we anticipated - to a dramatic slowdown in the approval of projects and the implementation of payments. As a result, was the annual implementation of commitments this fund at the end of June 2000 under one point. </seg>
<seg id=1882> This text is an ideal licence for a practical closure of the general secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg. </seg>
<seg id=1883> Before I left you said to me: " Christmas is just around the corner and we in Bergamo the celebrate Christmas and the Holy see Lucia. </seg>
<seg id=1884> Our strong criticism is also against the production of agricultural products and, on the other hand, that the information Eu committed to this surplus to sell. </seg>
<seg id=1885> Mr President, I voted for the report GarcÃ­a Margallo y Marfil on the equal treatment of electronic services erbrachter voted in favour. </seg>
<seg id=1886> Mr President, I will try to the before 2004 with a number of explanations of Malta to remedy. </seg>
<seg id=1887> I would, however, with a degree of solemnity say that this is the case was what I in a Europe can accept that, in my view, too liberal. </seg>
<seg id=1888> A deadlines would encourage the postal services, its services develop and to modernise and the planning and investment easier. </seg>
<seg id=1889> They will continue to exert pressure. With the money they in the service earn above the 150 grammes border, strengthen their position. </seg>
<seg id=1890> The liberalisation of postal services in the form proposed by the Commission is neither sensible nor uniform. That is why I voted for the report and all the amendments presented voted in this direction. </seg>
<seg id=1891> De Roo report (A5-0378/2000) </seg>
<seg id=1892> We have also against amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 our reservations, because we are not convinced that it with the rules of the wto are compatible. </seg>
<seg id=1893> Against globalisation, which is the most basic human rights rides roughshod over. </seg>
<seg id=1894> This would run counter to the respect for national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty on European Union). </seg>
<seg id=1895> It is worth emphasising that the lesser used languages by the globalisation of the Internet were not being, but it new opportunities opening up a cultural and economic have found. </seg>
<seg id=1896> Mr President, in the absence of other results, the Gefeilsche in Nice at least the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union made. </seg>
<seg id=1897> Of the joint motion for a resolution underlying ethos is in this respect, much too one-sided. </seg>
<seg id=1898> The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - the now four days after not yet officially available - shows how difficult it is to decisions which have been taken in a general confusion, clear on paper. </seg>
<seg id=1899> The only way to dangerous to avoid conflicts for the future, is to remain in the traditional concept, which is that Europe on mutual respect for national communities is based. </seg>
<seg id=1900> The Nice Summit is Sunday with an agreement to the very end, in a draft treaty result. </seg>
<seg id=1901> Today' s vote on the motion for a resolution on Nice does not reflect. </seg>
<seg id=1902> Finally, a comment on social policy, the France in the presentation of his presidency to tackle wanted. At the end of the day, it is now, in addition to the declarations of intent and fine, the content of vague documents, in the light of the existing problems and the great dissatisfaction, as you also of the workers in Nice was expressed so impressively, are totally inadequate, in a handful of details have been. </seg>
<seg id=1903> In the really important issues, such as taxes, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration, is apparently all in the old remained. </seg>
<seg id=1904> Impressive in the debate on Nice is the idea that the Treaty ultimately not mother still father - it is nobody' s child. The French Presidency has been in excuses, instead of clearly the results of the Intergovernmental Conference and the reasons for this support. </seg>
<seg id=1905> On the contrary, the influence of national democracies adopted, because the right of veto will be further reduced and the European Parliament more power to be given. </seg>
<seg id=1906> It would have been in the year in which I was born, so 1944, the conclusion of the agreement Chicago this anticipated effect, it would be at the time may not have been agreed, aviation fuel and other aircraft needs of the tax exempt. </seg>
<seg id=1907> Since a zero risk does not exist, have the scientists, or at least the politicians to apply the criterion of proportionality, unknown risks balance and responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=1908> This Parliament has but also fought to this reduction in the for the innovative measures available resources by use of the flexibility framework would be compensated, held in a statement on the financial perspective. </seg>
<seg id=1909> In this important area must all play a role, since it in this truly global market in which we now move to the new ideas are properly funded, relevantly and realistically underpinned - which will ensure that we in Europe our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and, in particular, in the communication technology can say. </seg>
<seg id=1910> On the question of the budget are in the previous speech serious words already been said: EUR 400 million are in fact only a minimum for the financing, and in the second half of must by the flexibility instrument opportunities additional funding can be used, as the report was presented. </seg>
<seg id=1911> This must, in my view, not, as the report concludes, automatically the loss of European added value to go hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id=1912> As we all know, is the problem of unemployment in the European Union at the highest in the economically and technologically less developed regions, especially in the objective 1 areas. The innovative measures must not only technological nature, but must also be taken of the specific will, economy and employment. </seg>
<seg id=1913> If I now back in my own region, therefore, eastern England, am and note that not a single authority the last period has used this money, then, I doubt whether we have are effective, as we in the future, so that we new communities can welcome. </seg>
<seg id=1914> Mr President, I would like to begin by Helmuth Markov for his constructive and very competent approach to the proposal for a communication on innovative measures of the efre in the period 2000-2006 thank and express my appreciation to him. </seg>
<seg id=1915> The energy efficiency and environmental aspects have in these guidelines their place. They can cause for innovative actions to the third subject, the regional development and sustainable development. </seg>
<seg id=1916> We would, however, that these projects are selected at regional level, as Mr nous Berend in his speech very well understood. </seg>
<seg id=1917> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=1918> That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three amendments which have been tabled in addition, the Commission' s efforts, an international dispute settlement procedure before the wto to increase. </seg>
<seg id=1919> It seems to me that the Commissioner to the industry must show that it is making every effort to ensure that this external threat to our industry to deal with. </seg>
<seg id=1920> Finally, we expect that the shipbuilding industry on income at the meeting of the group of 6 of the oecd on 18 December will be discussed. </seg>
<seg id=1921> However, it looks as will the final repeatedly somewhat delayed, so that we never be crossing the finishing line. </seg>
<seg id=1922> As you all know, it is only the beginning the process on six months take. </seg>
<seg id=1923> For the large corporations as for their political lawyers means the demand for less State only that the state and its finances you only available to them. </seg>
<seg id=1924> However, to this end, precisely so that the shipbuilding industry and consolidate the jobs and the families dependent on the sector can be given security, are on the 31 December 2000 aid necessary, because the market situation is not by equal opportunities, but by unfair competition and dumping marked. </seg>
<seg id=1925> To improve the competitiveness of the eu-werften will be promoted by the Commission, but in view of the massive Preisunterbietung by the Korean shipyards is achievable productivity growth not enough. </seg>
<seg id=1926> The Council stressed that this support mechanism competition within the Eu must not distort. </seg>
<seg id=1927> The presence of the atom-u-boots havarierten in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear and colonial power and a Member State second category, as the last classification of Nice is extended, the its rights not demands and statements infantilen prevents. </seg>
<seg id=1928> As a result of the medical report, in the country of Besitzers - that is to say, by the British press, was spread of the disease schwere was aware, was not transfer to a different hospital, but an amendment to the classification of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id=1929> Of course, we await with interest the response of the Commission to determine whether the objective has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1930> Mr President, I too would like to start by the family of the murdered council and the members of the people' sParty my condolences and disgust on this fascist barbarity of eta and their accomplices to express. </seg>
<seg id=1931> I also believe that it is advisable to the u boat tireless as soon as possible, as soon as the relevant climatic conditions are met, to repair to Britain to transfer. </seg>
<seg id=1932> Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission is of the opinion that the directive 89/618/Euratom on informing the general public in a radiological emergency situation and directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic safety standards with regard to this situation are applied and what steps therefore have been taken. </seg>
<seg id=1933> We are in the framework of the normal not justified complaints procedure, this answer to make public, although we generally able to say what it says. </seg>
<seg id=1934> There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty, which is the transportation of waste kontaminierter between the Member States of the European Union. Gibraltar is now but the United Kingdom, and would contaminated waste from one part of the United Kingdom in another part of the country, transported without another Member State of the European Union to happen. </seg>
<seg id=1935> Spain needs to do so only the confidence of the people on the rocks to win. </seg>
<seg id=1936> Here we have a Member State, with the public of another Member State is as it with any other country in the world would be, as if it fifty years after the start of the European integration were no affectio societatis, as if the European solidarity not the slightest progress would have made. </seg>
<seg id=1937> Indeed operierte in British waters to a certain point the only a German " boat. </seg>
<seg id=1938> There will be debated, but the citizens your attention aware or can intuitively to the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1939> As a result of the cuts that the labour government has been made in the defence budget, are less money to the acquisition of new military equipment available, so that in future, with more is expected to cases in which Defekte technology for necessary repairs decommissioned must be. </seg>
<seg id=1940> The competence of the Community Â­ how much this perhaps some very different wishes Â­ extends not, however, on the classification of ports to carry out repairs to Unterseebooten still on the issues of technical safety of reactors or on demands that a U boat to repair elsewhere must be made. </seg>
<seg id=1941> To you even better able to help, we should call on the Community institutions, the financial, human and material resources of the unhcr increase. </seg>
<seg id=1942> I call on the Commission, the financial assistance for the unhcr to rectify and in all its agreement with the nro the unhcr always as coordinate expel. </seg>
<seg id=1943> It must therefore have access to the civilian victims, and his team, on the ground must certainly be able to move and on the resources necessary for the fulfilment of its mission have. </seg>
<seg id=1944> On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on the common asylum procedure and uniform EU-wide status of the recognised asylum seekers - that is the Tampere established ultimate objective of the common European asylum system. </seg>
<seg id=1945> Finally, I should like to express my appreciation for all the work bezeigen by Mrs Ogata for the unhcr has been done and Mr Ruud Lubbers all well in his new post wish. </seg>
<seg id=1946> We think it is important for this to restore, on a political amnesty to press in Yugoslavia, but it is essential, in our view, that we the new act of violence and terrorist activities at the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo in condemn clearly, because this worrying in the form of the events remind us during the Kosovo conflict, in which western powers responsibility contributed. </seg>
<seg id=1947> Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of our compromise document contains clear demands. </seg>
<seg id=1948> I also appeal to the President Kostunica, clarify what with people like Mr Ukshin Hoti has happened with whose fate we have repeatedly discussed, and of whose fate we nothing is known. </seg>
<seg id=1949> I can also agree appeal to the kfor further attacks in the Presevo valley to prevent. </seg>
<seg id=1950> I welcome the now taken by the kfor steps to deal with the problem and urge continue to all sides, to urge to exercise restraint. </seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0916/2000 by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and others, on behalf of the pse-fraktion; </seg>
<seg id=1952> This clause was in March 1990 in moneda-palast decided. I know this so well because I had the privilege, there in the office of President aylwin after the Plebiszit, which the regime of general Pinochet, an end to be here. </seg>
<seg id=1953> Mr President, values, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something to the resolution, for which we, of course, will vote. </seg>
<seg id=1954> Here, the international community has the right to exercise democratic control, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political, caution and preventive action. </seg>
<seg id=1955> The situation in the prisons and to the police stations, which, among other things, abuse and torture are commonplace, is completely unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id=1956> This treatment is precisely in Western Europe, and as a result of protests from the Minister has hikmet Sami Turk postponed the transfer to the whole of Turkey a social and political consensus on a prison reform can be developed. </seg>
<seg id=1957> The matter is urgent, and that is why we have decided to this item on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id=1958> He should on 8 January next year will be made of the process. We he raises, in a Tunisian Assembly oppositioneller in France took part in what he however, disputes. </seg>
<seg id=1959> If the members and officials of these associations on the anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights want to hold a meeting, their homes are surrounded by the police, and anyone who dares to the streets of men in civil attacked. </seg>
<seg id=1960> The second case is really only a part of a network of harassment. </seg>
<seg id=1961> My group, like this Parliament, is following the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world with particular attention. </seg>
<seg id=1962> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, moderate we ask a little. </seg>
<seg id=1963> The negotiations were very good, and I am very pleased that we are making progress here and I hope that the discussions on the result, which the honourable Member referred. </seg>
<seg id=1964> Several Members languages the situation of the prisoners in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=1965> B5-0912/2000 by Mr Johan van Hecke, on behalf of the ppe-de-fraktion; </seg>
<seg id=1966> We should you, I believe that in this position not lag behind. </seg>
<seg id=1967> Within this framework, the rise to power of the army, which, as always, only served to the situation worse. </seg>
<seg id=1968> This attitude is part of the continuity of the policy of French imperialism. </seg>
<seg id=1969> The Commission is also on the recent violence very concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1970> The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed. </seg>
<seg id=1971> Unfair competition can destroy a good shipbuilding climate, the loss of know-how and jobs and in the long term, lead to a monopoly of the detrimental to the world trade. </seg>
<seg id=1972> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting </seg>
<seg id=1973> That is why I would like to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation, and to the amendments, and the experts of the Committee, which significantly contributed to the motion for a resolution signed, sealed and delivered. </seg>
<seg id=1974> On the adoption of the social policy agenda by the Nice European Council, we are delighted, and we hope that the Member States will take advantage of this opportunity to the social security and health for concern systems for the elderly develop and coordinate them better, at the same time, but also other measures, their ensure reintegration into the active life, such as lifelong learning. </seg>
<seg id=1975> The promotion of lifelong learning, an issue that has been mentioned in the debate is one thing, which I support. </seg>
<seg id=1976> People over 60 or 70 years, of course, there are many do useful things, but it is not right to their income in this age of the work he has done to link. </seg>
<seg id=1977> The European Central Bank in its month report of July 2000 already properly warned. </seg>
<seg id=1978> In my opinion, the Member States can the problem with the help of its legislative instruments better way. </seg>
<seg id=1979> Thanks to your proposals for an active life in old age is society a whole generation to add. </seg>
<seg id=1980> The promises made must be respected, but the pensions are with the resources to ensure these countries, without the payment at the expense of the common financial policy Eu must be guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id=1981> We have the greatest social revolution in the last 100 bis 150 years experienced by the age of us people doubled. </seg>
<seg id=1982> It only gives the arithmetic extension of life, which has been made possible by the medical progress, a sense. </seg>
<seg id=1983> You could pay - the society was involved, older workers,, but young workers have not been stopped and there have been many positions deleted. </seg>
<seg id=1984> The family and fiscal policy should instead ensure that men and women, the family, be free to decide whether or not they work want to be or not. </seg>
