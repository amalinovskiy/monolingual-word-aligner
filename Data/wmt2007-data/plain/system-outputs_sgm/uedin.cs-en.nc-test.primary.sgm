<seg id=1> A racially divided Europe</seg>
<seg id=2> In fact, the extreme right is its racism and that uses immigration issue in its political benefits.</seg>
<seg id=3> Italy's lega nord, the Dutch vlaams bloc, the French Le Pen National Front - all are examples of parties or movement vzešlých of common aversion to immigrants and prosazujících simple view of how address immigrants.</seg>
<seg id=4> While individua like Jörg Haider or Jean-Marie Le Pen, and (never quite soon) odcházejí, the question race and racism of European politicians and immediately will not merely go away if ignored.</seg>
<seg id=5> For the growing racial roztříštěností in European countries, two factors: aging populations and otevírající the boundaries.</seg>
<seg id=6> Right and left party concentrated around the political center schovávají before this problem capita in the sand, doufajíce despite everything that question immigration one itself will disappear.</seg>
<seg id=7> But, as the US racial history.</seg>
<seg id=8> Relations between rasami stands in the United States has long decades in the center of political debate, to the extent that racial divisions are as important as income, and often are determined by political preferences and attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=9> The first step toward a Communist racial policy is understand počátkům and the consequences of racial intolerance, even if that become home truths.</seg>
<seg id=10> In the United States, the last massive economic, the sociological, psychological and politologické surveys.</seg>
<seg id=11> Comes from them, that people different races, other much less they trust their that white are loathe favor social spending, because they are seen as aid minorities, and that a racially dilute community are much less effective public administration, is rampant corruption in protežování and crime, and a less productive public goods to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=12> Of course, this does not mean that the solution is to eliminate all diversity and to build a racially homogeneous community, but that to build a solid public policy on the relations between different rasami, we must in the first place in the first to admit the existence of these problems.</seg>
<seg id=13> Of course, nor Americans are not in this direction united.</seg>
<seg id=14> Some are positive discrimination, which minorities admits preferences in hiring in work on high school and in allocating public procurement.</seg>
<seg id=15> This policy is perceived not only as compensation for historical grievances, but also as a way to human positive examples and persistent, and perhaps bezděčné discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=16> But it is, and many people who against positive discrimination rail and who argue that to vznikala jobs for the minority and to black family remained together, it requires only quality, ,rasoslepá "policy coupled with policies of the free market and support of the family values.</seg>
<seg id=17> Support for family values is crucial in any policy, because the most important news arising causes of poverty in the US is the huge amounts of households with one rodičem (for that read Russian: the free mother) in the black communities.</seg>
<seg id=18> While there is no solution, but here it is mostly that American policy to racial issue at least one's attitude.</seg>
<seg id=19> Minority here, of course, a pokročily on the road to integration and economic success.</seg>
<seg id=20> In the 1950's, were told not blacks sit in the first part of the autobusu; today, two blacks move to the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=21> American right-wing politicians, of course, and now takticky use racial question as a political tool.</seg>
<seg id=22> For example, patrick Buchanan, a former aide to presidents Nixon's head and Reagan in the American presidential election ran as an independent.</seg>
<seg id=23> To succeed, a book entitled, ,umírající the West "about how vymírající populations and invasion of immigrants threaten America and Western civilization.</seg>
<seg id=24> But for every one such book is ten other that America's racial question addresses serious analysis.</seg>
<seg id=25> In Europe, but the political analysis and debate about relations between different rasami significantly is lagging.</seg>
<seg id=26> At best, the issue is a omezeně, in the sense of imigračních quotas and border limits, and not in the sense of social problems and opportunities that racially smíšená Europe offers.</seg>
<seg id=27> To stop the rise in illegal immigrants, of course, is needed clear immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id=28> But it by the story: America's racial politics also does it kontrolami on the US-Mexican border!</seg>
<seg id=29> Europe is rich and kvapem ageing. Europeans, protected generous social programs, refuse to do ,špinavou work "in agriculture or in kožařském industry.</seg>
<seg id=30> The increase in immigrants is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=31> Europeans, but never leave the opportunity to to criticized America for any its failures in policy on minorities or for any speech racism on the other side of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id=32> When začteme into the European press, cannot be the nevšimnout of some of the primacy of the United States in the issue of racial policy: they, things, with the rasismem problems, we, Europeans, we are against him immune, perhaps to poblázněné neonacisty and similar.</seg>
<seg id=33> But what happened in recent weeks from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that rasový problem is in Europe much deeper and that, as well as in the US is the sad truth that relations between rasami are the nature of complex and that trust and cooperation between human rasami is not always self-evident, and easy.</seg>
<seg id=34> Nezačnou-li major European political parties in all of vážností and frankness to invest in understanding of racial tensions in Europe and without racial question one of their main priority, vězme that individuals Le Pen of will not hesitate to this vacuum naplnili its nenávistným message.</seg>
<seg id=35> The battle with the French exception</seg>
<seg id=36> Europe's attention to the right to enlargement and the European Constitution, which currently vypracovávají EU member states.</seg>
<seg id=37> For the fate of new and enlarged Europe will be equally important result of a few French rozmíšek with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=38> France decided to be unilaterally to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact, because its předpokládaný budget deficit highly beyond the 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=39> The French, like to boast about a rational and střízlivým uvažováním, but when it comes to budgets, then descartese replaced confusion between terms.</seg>
<seg id=40> When the Irish government in 2000 reduce its budget surplus of 4% of GDP for being a mere 1%, France to its leading kritikům.</seg>
<seg id=41> The Stability Pact already porušily and other countries, but France is the first, who do so with pošklebky and open vzdorem.</seg>
<seg id=42> But it should not come as a surprise.</seg>
<seg id=43> France simply he applies to the rules of the EU its built-in habit of sensitive to their own culture as an exceptional.</seg>
<seg id=44> The French, for example, have vetují reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.</seg>
<seg id=45> But even children know that this policy is good and a nezaslouženým gift from rich European (and particularly French farmers) at the expense of struggling farmers in developing countries and consumers in the EU.</seg>
<seg id=46> France is also seek to return to the old politics resort non-profit private companies stojících on the brink of bankruptcy money on taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id=47> The EU competition Commissioner Mario Monti this battle cannot embark on: needs support of those who believe in the free market and equal conditions for all.</seg>
<seg id=48> The story is simple.</seg>
<seg id=49> The French government planning to save society alstom, which has developed a series of high technology products, including the train tgv, but recently has imposed bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id=50> The government claims that the plan to save alstomu never it; he is motivated by well known dirigistickými motives: to maintain employment protection of investors, etc.</seg>
<seg id=51> Moreover, because it is alstom technological companies, vytahuje the French government also card research and development and argues that investments in research and development stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id=52> Saving alstomu zestátněním is clearly wrong.</seg>
<seg id=53> This society is composed of many different parts of the, some of which are profit and other krachují: it would be simple business divide.</seg>
<seg id=54> Profitable, such as tgv, a easily be found, while non-profit facilities should be contracted.</seg>
<seg id=55> French money on taxpayers would have been more efficiently spent on a temporary support dismissed workers than on subsidies that will maintain alive unprofitable factory.</seg>
<seg id=56> It is important to the European Commission neumožnila France ušít in the competition for peace special rules, as has clearly happening in the budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=57> The Commission must Arab state aid French private companies, as well as from subsidies in any other country.</seg>
<seg id=58> Here the Commission reached certain success, in particular, when forced Germany to zrušilo government guarantees on state owned banks.</seg>
<seg id=59> France as a whole and firm alstom particularly should not be exception and should follow the same standards.</seg>
<seg id=60> If the Commission will act, the EU will remind even more hřiště for the French state officials.</seg>
<seg id=61> France today's leadership in the EU foreign policy, where Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin increasingly looks and acts as Secretary of State of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=62> At the same time, France has a key rules common economic policy and state aid private companies.</seg>
<seg id=63> Lose the European Commission residue of its credibility and will eventually remind smaller Paris be?</seg>
<seg id=64> Defeat in the case of alstomu should for Europe profound implications - and not only on economic competition.</seg>
<seg id=65> The war over the oil</seg>
<seg id=66> For decades, America through democratic and presidential administrations meets in the oil politics several přímočarých goals: to maintain the world oil prices to be as stable, what nejbezbolestněji to reduce domestic consumption of oil; reduce according to the possibility of dependence on imports from abroad; to diversify sources of oil importů.</seg>
<seg id=67> While it may seem, none of these goals for the Bush administration did not change.</seg>
<seg id=68> Many observers believe that Bush udal a new direction, it seems that the invasion of Iraq, these goals, contrary to the.</seg>
<seg id=69> Substantial production in Iraq is likely to increase dependence on the US on oil compared to other energy sources, because the new reserves probably oil prices fall.</seg>
<seg id=70> This will mean in US dependence on oil imports, especially from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=71> Ironically, however, is that the US should over the Iraqi oil sector much more power during the pre-war program of the UN, ,ropa for food "(in which not Saddam Hussein, but the UN určovala level of selling of Iraqi oil abroad), rather than they have in the future a democratic Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=72> If Bush's government was a permanent, secure, varied and cheap oil supplies, could simply to lift the Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan and oil would only řinula.</seg>
<seg id=73> America's interest in the Iraqi oil, however, was not motivated or economic or energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=74> The Bush Administration point that the Iraqi oil is mainly by geopolitical asset for.</seg>
<seg id=75> Who controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=76> Saddam's power means that ovládal the second largest world oil supplies.</seg>
<seg id=77> The role of the oil in his power sehrávala, a very well it.</seg>
<seg id=78> When Saddam forced to confront the possibility of an invasion and defeat, he was zapálením Iraqi oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=79> Much of the then the and or oil equipment and pipelines in the country reflected the widespread perception that dominate oil means to dominate Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=80> At a time when the US planned invasion, has become a major priority security oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=81> The goal was not the oil supplies or reduce its prices for Americans, but to Saddam power and in posledku establish and to consolidate the new Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg id=82> The future of Iraq directly depends on the fate of the Iraqi of oil production.</seg>
<seg id=83> But the vagaries of the oil industry, especially for such unstable conditions, it is difficult to see how will be in the next few years, the Bush administration to fulfill its goals in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=84> The logic is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85> The US must oil revenues to use to of American tax payers sejmuly the burden of the financing of regime change in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=86> Any plans reconstruction in the long term rely on the ability of Iraq to export large objemy oil.</seg>
<seg id=87> If it fails Iraq oil price, President Bush cannot meet promises to be Iraqi and the American people and the world community.</seg>
<seg id=88> To invade Iraq's oil production capacity was three million barrels per day.</seg>
<seg id=89> During the deadline that is required to set the Iraqi government will not be able to Iraq's increase at that level.</seg>
<seg id=90> Every increase in Iraq's oil production will require preparation sources to develop, investment, legitimate parliamentary government and political stability.</seg>
<seg id=91> Early fulfilling the demands neočekává or the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg id=92> The political stability is the main for increased production capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93> Historical experience from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even from the Iraq suggest that from rebuild the political stability is needed about three years, than capacity significantly, and the new, higher level of is here to stay.</seg>
<seg id=94> Iraq needs a few years to write a new constitution, a legitimate democratic government sjednal division of oil revenues between individual regions, introduced a new investment laws and made its economy přitažlivým for foreigners.</seg>
<seg id=95> It also needs a time for negotiations with international oil companies and neighboring countries to do the technical analysis and studies applicability become more important and reconstruction, modernization and survey of its oil deposits.</seg>
<seg id=96> As optimistic so even tříletý timetable for the, which assumes that during the deadline will end the occupation and Iraqis sestaví their democratic government and that will be achieved political stability.</seg>
<seg id=97> The situation, of course, can completely different.</seg>
<seg id=98> Tensions can continue for years.</seg>
<seg id=99> Moreover, no one should be surprised that, if Iraq's oil production and under a democratic government suddenly has stalled.</seg>
<seg id=100> History suggests that workers strikes and similar shocks that can extracting oil stop, are greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries.</seg>
<seg id=101> If Iraq can in the next few years in its production capacity, this obstacle to both foreign and energy policy, the US.</seg>
<seg id=102> How will the US long-term reconstruction Iraq finance?</seg>
<seg id=103> Who will efforts to preserve the fragile Iraqi democracy?</seg>
<seg id=104> Will the occupation for the US sustainable if will not be able to ensure the Iraqi people food, health care, and other basic services?</seg>
<seg id=105> It is a difficult questions that are essentially nezodpověditelné to in Iraq stable, democratic regime able to control and to guarantee the uninterrupted flow of oil exports.</seg>
<seg id=106> Let the murderers be mobilized over the human rights</seg>
<seg id=107> If it was not so deeply dismal, the report might be šibeniční anekdotou Millennium: Libya was elected předsednickou countries Commission on Human Rights in the UN!</seg>
<seg id=108> When caligula he chose the Senate its horse had his horse at least carried out blood.</seg>
<seg id=109> Progress was, of course, is zákonný: the each year shifting from one of the region to another.</seg>
<seg id=110> This year, which proposed Minister Africa and nominovala Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111> Only voted against the US and Canada.</seg>
<seg id=112> Its eternal blame the European countries zdržely voting.</seg>
<seg id=113> It is a commentary on the moral bankruptcy of the UN, that this decision comes at the moment for organization and choulostivém.</seg>
<seg id=114> President Bush called for the UN to has made clear that takes seriously their own binding decisions concerning Iraq: it would otherwise be as neslavně as society nations that in the 1930s occurred as ineffective, when should face aggressive political treat Nazi Germany and the fascist Italy.</seg>
<seg id=115> A now Libya to take the body of the UN, who is responsible for human rights, hardly to strengthen the legitimacy and moral authority world organizations.</seg>
<seg id=116> Consider the: Libya is totalitarian tyranny. Kaddáfí Muammar leader, be enriching their sometimes nevypočitatelné behavior extrémistickými political approaches and supports the world dictators.</seg>
<seg id=117> Heads the one of nejrepresivnějších regimes in the world, where elections, nothing nepředstírá and dissent, it is constantly after each other's throats.</seg>
<seg id=118> Under his rule Libya help terrorist organizations from all over the world - from the IRA to different Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg id=119> So far, is under sanction the UN because of the role played by a decade ago in pumovém the assassination of airplane society panam over a Scottish Lockerbie.</seg>
<seg id=120> In the past decade, the status of the UN as symbolu ideals of peaceful world society's turn intensified.</seg>
<seg id=121> The organization occurred as completely unable to stop the wars in the Balkans, at least in case - in Srebrenica, Dutch mírotvorné the UN force, the and sat worst massacre in postwar Europe, when the Bosnian Serbs were around six thousand bezbranných Muslim men.</seg>
<seg id=122> The Dutch investigative commission later, the banner of the UN should give a crime spoluvinu.</seg>
<seg id=123> At a time when in Rwanda, genocide, leader of the UN responsible for the mírotvorné operations an evacuation UN troops from countries and ponechal fields, open nejkrvavějšímu genocidnímu massacre from the World War II.</seg>
<seg id=124> This official UN names Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125> It is a severe and poor record in history, which the UN to - perhaps to no avail - all that in the Iraq crisis he appears as a voice senses and international legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=126> But at a time when the UN inspections remind army in Iraq vyslanou salvation odpravit group gangsterů, boost Libya to chair the for human rights can in history classes as the eventual failure organization, whose lives began with as many expectations.</seg>
<seg id=127> The usually do not die of - and certainly is reason for this, to ensure that the UN will kulhat further.</seg>
<seg id=128> But it will only stínem what should and could be.</seg>
<seg id=129> The United Nations is no longer hypocrisy neodpáře.</seg>
<seg id=130> Autoritáři at the Gate</seg>
<seg id=131> Last čtvrtek me with the judges conspicuous central court in Jakarta to one in prison.</seg>
<seg id=132> As the editor of the intelligence weekly pace, I according to the Court provinil nactiutrháním against business magnátovi on behalf of the tomy winata, I indirectly suggested that his possible share of požáru textile market for Southeast Asia in Jakarta and that I the spread of lie stoked the country's overwhelmingly to riots by.</seg>
<seg id=133> It is my case and cases others of the end of the other short-term experiment with democracy in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134> The "výtržnost", which I supposedly stoked the country's overwhelmingly, comes in may last year, with almost two hundreds of hrdlořezů označujících for winatovy adherents přepadly office weekly pace, threatening to vypálením buildings, obtěžovaly workers and zranily one reportéra.</seg>
<seg id=135> In an attempt to help the situation, I has to negotiations on the central police station in Jakarta, but its abhorrence of I found that the station control leaders for that gang of.</seg>
<seg id=136> Those bili me and kopali, while the police it looks backward rather than elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=137> Fortunately, the US to help přispěchalo many journalists, zapnutými diktafony and kamerami.</seg>
<seg id=138> Their broadcasting have public outrage, which přinutilo parliament organize public hearings.</seg>
<seg id=139> It were předvoláni national and jakartský police chief and leaders gang of were on the basis of a strong pressure public charged with felony.</seg>
<seg id=140> But the winata policejnímu investigations escape, and not only on the basis of public statements that his supporters acting without his the previous knowledge or consent.</seg>
<seg id=141> Winata then a their criminal announcement of Ahmad taufika that an article, he wrote teuku iskandara aliho that it editoval, and I.</seg>
<seg id=142> Celoroční proceedings then there was a number of suspects arrives at all, zvýhodňovaly winatu.</seg>
<seg id=143> So, above all, the plaintiffs written police and state prosecutor fraudulent documents, and a tawdry in a way that police obvinila two of its own.</seg>
<seg id=144> The Court, however, refused to our request for both management until objasní právoplatnost state sepsané courts.</seg>
<seg id=145> The case of officers zapletených to make appears to be leads to lost.</seg>
<seg id=146> One of them was even reinstated on commander newly constituted (and the United States sponsored) anti-terrorist forces in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=147> The second then was allegedly poslán at the police Academy, where absolvuje pokročilý training.</seg>
<seg id=148> šestý month projednávání suits was předsedající judge in tříčlenném Senate suddenly povýšena on předsedkyni a court in the city distant hour away down from Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=149> One of my advokátů noted that 35 years practice in the courts even hasn't to předsedající judge fired from has an ongoing case.</seg>
<seg id=150> Judge, despite the elevation continue to předsedala court in another case projednávaném in the same,.</seg>
<seg id=151> On the surface released by judges, took place in the winatově civil lawsuit against in referred to the.</seg>
<seg id=152> And the winata committed during the svědecké testimony křivopřísežnictví when denied that with the pace of dělalo conversation.</seg>
<seg id=153> Before the Court was přehrán record of this telefonního conversation, the Court heard another leading místopřísežnou svědeckou testimony reportéra conversation, which led the, and two editors, who in this, as evidence of the existence of telefonátu was put to official record telephone society and technical witness reached to conclude that the voice on nahrávce really belongs tomymu winatovi.</seg>
<seg id=154> Judges but rejected the application of that winata was arrested and tried for křivopřísežnictví, and told her us that we have ohlásit on the police, which we did.</seg>
<seg id=155> Judges then rejected and our request for the Court's decision to resolve the case winatova křivopřísežnictví.</seg>
<seg id=156> Given the so pochybenému management was my conviction and nepodmíněný punishment surprise.</seg>
<seg id=157> Still neztrácím hope that we win to begin to appeal of heard courts higher of last resort.</seg>
<seg id=158> Higher Indonesia's courts are cleaner and the Supreme Court is věrným loyal to democracy and freedom of the press. Case weekly rate could become památným victory for our democracy, just as he became famous US Supreme Court decision in the New York Times vs. Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159> By raising laťky for courts for harshly ensure that American journalists can dash public officials to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=160> No country knows better than Indonesia, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are ověřenými ukazateli democratic development and that kriminalizace journalists is raný sign authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161> In the 1950's, was Indonesia liberal democracy, as long as in 1956 nezahájil President sukarno for support for the military campaign against the press.</seg>
<seg id=162> Umlčení critical voices usnadnilo consolidation his unchecked power and in June 1959 declared sukarno the beginning of "controlled democracy."</seg>
<seg id=163> Within a few of the first years after sukarnově fall in 1966 were all the benefits of a real democracy, including the freedom of the press obnoveny (for the communists, but not).</seg>
<seg id=164> Regime of President suharta but in the early 1970's to start another strong measures against the press, leading to the various media and imprisonment of many journalists.</seg>
<seg id=165> Once was brought under control the press, was already quickly okleštěna and other political rights and Indonesia's democracy again collapsed.</seg>
<seg id=166> After suhartově fall in 1998, Indonesia became a third largest democratic country in the world, and the Muslim communities in history.</seg>
<seg id=167> Two parliamentary elections, and two direct presidential election - including the recent second-round run-off presidential contests - were free, fair, and peaceful, which could that Islam and democracy can co-exist.</seg>
<seg id=168> The enemies of democracy, however, never nespí.</seg>
<seg id=169> Radical Islamist groups have been criticized mindless horrific attacks, while groups with strong authoritarian: they go to nejužších circles around state Megawati Sukarnoputri.</seg>
<seg id=170> President Megawati, however, it is diminished defeat in their quest for re-election.</seg>
<seg id=171> Will the newly elected president susilo continue in persecution journalists?</seg>
<seg id=172> It is my conviction, as well as the processes and condemnation of other journalists, mark the beginning of the end hard-won third democracy in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=173> The answer lies in the about what support can Indonesia's fighters for democracy to gain at home and abroad.</seg>
<seg id=174> The loss of Indonesia - the potential světélka hope for all combatants for democracy in the global Muslim community - would be terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg id=175> Morálnost death penalty</seg>
<seg id=176> The United States are often kritizovány for refusing to lift the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=177> Many people now claims that the death penalty is necessary for civilizovaného system criminal law.</seg>
<seg id=178> The Nobel laureate Gary becker with this the disagree.</seg>
<seg id=179> European governments, it adamantly opposed to death penalty -- the European Union him even explicitly forbids -- and some Europeans consider his application in the United States for's barbaric.</seg>
<seg id=180> Many European intellectuals argues that not only the death penalty, but in general any punishment cannot criminals deter.</seg>
<seg id=181> But, while Europeans, in which the crime, in the last half-century was well below the American levels, long could most of the crimes afford relatively "soft" approach, during the last years of the twenty years reap they a sharp increase in crime.</seg>
<seg id=182> America's crime, by contrast, partly because of the wider use of punishment.</seg>
<seg id=183> Between them are and the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=184> I execution people usvědčených of murder, because -- and only for this reason, I believe that the předejde another murders.</seg>
<seg id=185> If I believed, I posed against hrdelnímu punishment, because msta and other possible motives should serve as the basis of public policy.</seg>
<seg id=186> Serious empirical research death penalty began in the US encouragement isaaca studies ehrlicha, published in 1975 in the American economic review.</seg>
<seg id=187> Some subsequent studies revealed much weaker deterrence effect, while others reached to conclude that the effect is far more.</seg>
<seg id=188> Available data, however, are quite limited, so that no one should their inferences based solely on the econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg id=189> Public policy in the area of any punishment, of course, cannot wait until will have a perfect evidence.</seg>
<seg id=190> Even with limited access to quantitative evidence, however, there are good reasons to believe that the death penalty has deterrence effect.</seg>
<seg id=191> Most people -- and vrazi especially -- is of death fear, especially when it quickly and likely to after the murder.</seg>
<seg id=192> As in the debate over suicide declared philosopher David Hume, "no one never neodhodil life, as long as it was to live.</seg>
<seg id=193> Neb such is our natural unbearable of death... ", and schopenhauer believed that the" when of life reached the stage of death, one in which will outweigh the end of his life.</seg>
<seg id=194> But the death of place great resistance... "</seg>
<seg id=195> Opponents of the death penalty often proclaim that the state has no moral right to take some life, even if it were a nejodsouzeníhodnějšího murderer.</seg>
<seg id=196> For anyone who believes that the death penalty deter, but it is completely wrong conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=197> To understand the reason, suppose that for every murderer, which is executed (and thus not vyměřen, for example, life sentence), the number of the murder of lower three, which is much smaller number, than in their odhadech odstrašujícího effect, argues Ehrlich and some other.</seg>
<seg id=198> This means that for every nepopraveného murderer would died three innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=199> If so, the government neuplatňovala the death penalty, indirectly, the "sebrala" many lives.</seg>
<seg id=200> Saving three of innocent lives for every popraveného man seems very seductive trade, and even the two zachráněné on the lives of popravu represent convincing the ratio of the costs and returns hrdelního punishment.</seg>
<seg id=201> Admittedly, with the decline of zachráněných lives per popravu this argument in favor of the death penalty to pádnosti.</seg>
<seg id=202> But even if every execution saved only one human life, would still was this "trade" desirable in the case of that would be zachráněný life better than life odebraný, which would usually true.</seg>
<seg id=203> Many people have objected to comparing the quality of zachráněného and zmařeného life.</seg>
<seg id=204> I personally, I way to such comparisons to avoid.</seg>
<seg id=205> Consider, for example, "kariérního" criminals, which oloupí and zavraždí victim that led seamless life and left for children and her husband or manželku.</seg>
<seg id=206> And suppose that popravou such criminals could be saved the life of a single victims.</seg>
<seg id=207> According to me, it is obvious that saving life such victims must have greater weight than an end to zločincova life.</seg>
<seg id=208> Not all cases are, of course, such an unequivocal, but comparing qualities of individuals must be part of any reasonable social policy.</seg>
<seg id=209> This helps to explain why should be the death penalty vyměřován only for murder, and not for less serious crimes.</seg>
<seg id=210> If we should take poměřovat human lives and, for example, reducing the property criminal activity, it is an argument in favor of mírnějších thieves much stronger.</seg>
<seg id=211> Although the heavy harm to health, including some odious cases rape can its importance some murders approximate and could possibly shout for the penalty, I personally its use of these cases nepodporuji.</seg>
<seg id=212> The powerful argument for reducing the death penalty solely on the murder is the so-called "marginal deterrence."</seg>
<seg id=213> If, for example, the assault trestalo popravou, they would be perpetrators, its victims to kill to avoid finding (which is an important reason why the tvrdost punishment should be the magnitude of the crime).</seg>
<seg id=214> One of the komplikací associated with the hrdelním trestem may provide the fact that the guilty will sveřepěji to defend finding, which could lead to another deaths.</seg>
<seg id=215> Marginal deterrence, while plays an important role, but I believe that the opposition of murderers to finding some at the cost of losing their life is, in fact, indirectly showed that criminals benefit from the death penalty really fear.</seg>
<seg id=216> Of course, I I risks that they were innocent people.</seg>
<seg id=217> My support for the death penalty would greatly ochabla, if the percentage of Executions of innocent people really so high, as many claims.</seg>
<seg id=218> But I believe that odvolací process in the US has a huge protection -- perhaps not so much against nespravedlivému conviction as against unjust popravě -- so cases kill innocent people there is very little, if any.</seg>
<seg id=219> This process, highly helped develop identification through DNA.</seg>
<seg id=220> And so can be repeat that the debate about the death penalty is in fact a debate about his odstrašujícím effect (which can lengthy appeals to reduce).</seg>
<seg id=221> I understand that some people 'these evidence are regarded, even when personally, I believe that the wrong, and at this point that against them on this issue talk and sound common sense.</seg>
<seg id=222> Take some life is very disturbing, even if this was life murderer, but sometimes is needed to take even very hard steps to prevent even worse behavior, the lives of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=223> People versus Putin</seg>
<seg id=224> Finding successor first democratically elected Russia's President Boris Yeltsin, I helped with the selection of Vladimir Putin.</seg>
<seg id=225> Given that Russia now dominate structures at the edge of the KGB and mafia and the same structures manipulují soudním system, it is that the Yeltsin wanted to appoint of his successor to avoid the future prosecution.</seg>
<seg id=226> But we who we are Putin vybrali, we were pověřeni search for someone who would wealth would protect them Yeltsin and his family, but anyone who would continued in his reforms.</seg>
<seg id=227> Yeltsin really not fear and neusiloval about their survival, but for the survival of the democratic ideas, who in Russia,.</seg>
<seg id=228> Yet this idea is now at risk because's, for which we decided to.</seg>
<seg id=229> Nepopírám its responsibility for support Putin.</seg>
<seg id=230> We have close friends, but cooperating in critical situations, and I never doubted about its sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231> Putin is in accordance with their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id=232> The problem is that his beliefs -- including the view that Russia can prosper, only if it control the only source of power -- are is flawed.</seg>
<seg id=233> This is a mistake is Russia to political collapse.</seg>
<seg id=234> Of course, no one nezastává high function without nedělal mistakes, even mistakes fundamental, which is true in particular rough times.</seg>
<seg id=235> Yeltsin was no exception, its mistakes, however, the IMF recognized.</seg>
<seg id=236> For example, when the silvestra 1999 odcházel retirement, asked for debt for that launched a war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id=237> Putin, on the contrary, it appears to understand and acknowledge its mistakes and insists on a policy of long after for its failure to be clear the entire world.</seg>
<seg id=238> One of the Yeltsin mistakes was that the instead of his program of reform to a moral priorities.</seg>
<seg id=239> Russia should be kát for stalinismus and system Gulag sites.</seg>
<seg id=240> The nation to show for without exception, as it since 1945 show the Germans.</seg>
<seg id=241> This failure is important, because Putin's unqualified faith in the central power on the result in the state capture its security.</seg>
<seg id=242> Indeed, a direct result of national pokání for the era of Gulag sites should be on the Communist Party and diskvalifikace workers KGB of political functions.</seg>
<seg id=243> Even though in postcommunist societies where harassment and with were so widespread -- and the line between them often neostré -- are such political lustration process complicated, find reasonable solution was possible, as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244> Inaction left Russian security structures without damaging capable of political return, which they just managed.</seg>
<seg id=245> Political a revival structures of the KGB during Putin's governments and their efforts to umlčení dissent again have transformed Russia in the country sběhů.</seg>
<seg id=246> It is impossible to silence independent policies and independent media, independent nezadusíme-li sources of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin focused their attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."</seg>
<seg id=247> This is why it zorganizováno arrest and court of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.</seg>
<seg id=248> Security forces that control the Kremlin, hope that evicting that independent resources money will destroy in Russia, an independent political life.</seg>
<seg id=249> Without independent belief bases uchytávat is a fear.</seg>
<seg id=250> Fear, however, is not only humiliating; it also allows bad governance.</seg>
<seg id=251> Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and vertikálně controlled, centralized decisions are the right choice for management of modern country, and thus continue to reform relations between citizens and the state.</seg>
<seg id=252> Putin still not understand that a centralized political system now cannot understand mistakes and one of correcting is, as well as the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253> Putin, not well educated man, with the and a deep frankness leads Russia to the same decay that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet state.</seg>
<seg id=254> People are becoming aware of this.</seg>
<seg id=255> Understand that Putin's desire to build a powerful and effective modern state cannot be implemented, because the modern state is not controlled from above, but well informovaným electorates, forcing recognize that a representative of the state and one of correcting errors.</seg>
<seg id=256> Putin appears inability of his regime also concerned.</seg>
<seg id=257> This is one reason why Russia began to behave so aggressively to its neighbors and Georgia, Ukraine, and why seeks to maintain the military presence in places like Transdneister, odštěpenecký region Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258> The Kremlin thinks that děláním shoulder pains in the immediate neighborhood Russian can Russians at home to convince his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg id=259> Given the vykleštěnosti debates in Russia and the Kremlin ability manipulating elections, the only option, which remains those who want to in Russia maintain democratic the idea is regime change.</seg>
<seg id=260> Insistence on their ugly heads work.</seg>
<seg id=261> Those who oppose Putin, must twice what they want, and to declare that if regime cannot provide him with the constitution, have a right to make all necessary means.</seg>
<seg id=262> On the power in Russia cannot be resolved only at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id=263> As in Ukraine, in Lebanon, and Kyrgyzstan about it will decide on the streets.</seg>
<seg id=264> Daňte and utrácejte (Please)</seg>
<seg id=265> Excessive taxation can otupit incentives and slow growth.</seg>
<seg id=266> Too low taxation can lead to the same.</seg>
<seg id=267> Governments are skrovnými tax revenues to provide the basic public goods.</seg>
<seg id=268> Worse still, low tax revenues in poor countries often created by shortcomings system collecting taxes (rather than from low tax rates), including support neproduktivní business.</seg>
<seg id=269> The importance of well designed tax system is India.</seg>
<seg id=270> In Bangalore, high tech companies built areály on the world level, full šlechtěných trávníků and high speed networks for dálkový transfer of data.</seg>
<seg id=271> Beyond these areály, however, is an open stoky, the nesbírané scraps and roads in havarijním.</seg>
<seg id=272> Although society new technologies in any moment, terabajty information to remote continents, local transport is almost medieval speed.</seg>
<seg id=273> Businesses in Bangalore so have engaged in their own bus service, hire, private contractors drinking water, and made generátory to protect themselves against výpadkům supplies of electrical power.</seg>
<seg id=274> The state of this mess can correct, because it is broke.</seg>
<seg id=275> India's public debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so that more than half of the tax revenues the interest payments.</seg>
<seg id=276> Debt, however, did not create due to prevent excessive spending in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277> India's government spending are about 15% of GDP, with the average in the OECD around $40% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=278> India's financial problems are more from badly koncipovaného and Pakistani-administered tax system.</seg>
<seg id=279> Rates and rules of physical and corporate income taxes, according to international standards seems uměřeně.</seg>
<seg id=280> Nevertheless, India's government has income taxes of only about 3.7% of GDP, about half the compared to South Korea and other Asian tygrům.</seg>
<seg id=281> In India about a quarter of GDP is agriculture, but wealthy farmers are taxes.</seg>
<seg id=282> Much aimed at companies operating in software industry and other areas of their profits tax holidays, although their employees income taxes must pay.</seg>
<seg id=283> Despite reasonable rates are widespread tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id=284> To šizení occurs because the government neinvestovala into personnel or systems odhalujících tax podvodníky that rarely threatens the way to prison, and if chyceni, often through bribery problems collapse.</seg>
<seg id=285> In podrobnějším view that, "the direct" income taxes and profits mirror zmatky in a system of "indirect" tax imposed on production and consumption.</seg>
<seg id=286> More than 60% of indirect taxes, which have the same share of total tax revenues are in India taxes consumption.</seg>
<seg id=287> The basic consumer tax were defined in 16% of the value of output firms.</seg>
<seg id=288> In addition, there is a host relief, liberation and přirážek.</seg>
<seg id=289> For example, the category as hundreds products, zápalky, bavlněná příze and computer is imposed "snížená rate taxes" of $8%.</seg>
<seg id=290> Some products, including polyesterová by, cars, kondicionéry and tire leak, are burdened by additional "special consumer tax" (sed) of 8%.</seg>
<seg id=291> In "goods special significance" is imposed "přidaná consumer tax" (aed, on the difference from sed).</seg>
<seg id=292> Liberation from market taxes are numerous and complicated and related, including the companies celkovými annual tržbami to 10 million rupií and firms was in certain znevýhodněných or underdeveloped regions.</seg>
<seg id=293> Overall, the liberation of tied to 70 broad categories, rozčleněných to 259 lines, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each contains amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id=294> Fiscal liberation, they say about abuse.</seg>
<seg id=295> Lower officials, who have considerable discretion in the application of the conditions for a price to the fact příznivějším with stories.</seg>
<seg id=296> Goods zdaněné high rate (for example, leštěná žula) sells as goods zdaněné rate low (for example, neleštěná žula).</seg>
<seg id=297> Spotřebním avoiding taxes is nakažlivější than avoiding taxes from profits and revenue.</seg>
<seg id=298> When a firm consumer tax ever and tax rate is nezdaněnou profitable margins industry high, its konkurenti must also cheat, only to preserve.</seg>
<seg id=299> As tax evasion spread, governments introduce a "dodatkové" and "special" taxes, provoking another evasion.</seg>
<seg id=300> The choice of a direct taxes are also.</seg>
<seg id=301> Předaný bribe výběrčímu taxes for příznivou classification, the difference between the value leštěné and neleštěné žuly and reporting lower than real revenue creates a "black" funds that we cannot be tax returns.</seg>
<seg id=302> Pokoutní plans to evade indirect taxes not only weaken the state's ability to provide the basic public goods, but also discourage firms from the introduction of the produktivnějších technology that require procedures, including operating on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id=303> Given that indirectly taxes can be easily unikat provozováním many small organizations, rather than one big, cannot be achieved scale.</seg>
<seg id=304> Notable, in software industry, which are from indirect taxes osvobozeny all troops are Indian society efficient size.</seg>
<seg id=305> India could emulate the example of China, where rationalization, indirect taxes in 1994 set the stage for a appetite?</seg>
<seg id=306> Or coalition government vital democracy are not such reforms capable of?</seg>
<seg id=307> Last year, India's government led the BJP has offered legislation withdraw a budget deficit reduction.</seg>
<seg id=308> Then established a working group that to formulate necessary changes in the tax and expenditure policies.</seg>
<seg id=309> This year, in July, this group proposed tax increases (not škrtání spending), including through the removal of most of the liberation from indirect taxes.</seg>
<seg id=310> It seems that the new India's government led by Congress is totally also it is.</seg>
<seg id=311> If Congress and the opposition parties dotáhnou thing to do a piece of work to sustain economic growth and diffusion of opinion that democracy cannot do what it takes to stimulate development.</seg>
<seg id=312> What is wrong with the Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=313> On December face a Istanbul court one of the nejslavnějších Turkish writers Orhan Pamuk to faced the charge of "replied national identity" that supposedly committed by, open discussion about the Turkish genocide a million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.</seg>
<seg id=314> Pamukovi now threatens the three-year prison.</seg>
<seg id=315> Turkey's efforts to pokutovat and off to those who 'official line, me leads to the belief that I retain rightly, when I opposed accession negotiations that countries with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=316> In December 1999 udělila the European Council Turkey status EU candidate countries, it by a closer to nespecifikovanému date that Turkey to join the Union.</seg>
<seg id=317> The European Commission asked, in October 2004 decided to whether Turkey sufficiently fulfills political criteria of membership -- including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318> Was one of the recent decision Commission President Romano Prodi, which I.</seg>
<seg id=319> From 30 members of the Commission, 29 stating that Turkey sufficiently fulfills criteria, and negotiations may continue.</seg>
<seg id=320> The only I with the East.</seg>
<seg id=321> My decisions, shaped both report by the Commission, the Gunther Verheugen, the Commissioner for EU enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=322> The report is involved in 2003 made in the EU member states request for asylum 21 370 Turks and 2 127 and was taken.</seg>
<seg id=323> Even the governments of the EU itself in other words, they conceded that the Turkish government in 2003 perzekvovala more than two thousands of their own citizens.</seg>
<seg id=324> Meanwhile, the Commission released by the regular news about Turkey, in which připouštělo, it implies that islamisticky slightly recepa Prime Minister tayyipa erdogana continues in the reforms, but pace.</seg>
<seg id=325> Even the report, however, also involved a serious pochybeních: violations of human rights, including torture continued, the influence of the army was and remains too high, freedom of speech, nedodržovala widely, nemuslimské religious and cultural minorities, potýkaly with violence and discrimination against women was not enough to strongly bráněno.</seg>
<seg id=326> Since the accession talks this year in October, many changes.</seg>
<seg id=327> In addition to the current criminal prosecution orhana pamuka this only filled with other cases unacceptable happens behavior.</seg>
<seg id=328> In March 2005 police violence dispersed them demonstration of the commemoration of international day women.</seg>
<seg id=329> In may be zakázána the biggest odborovému Union teachers, because he championed education 14 million Turkish Kurds in their own language.</seg>
<seg id=330> Intolerance, it extends to at the top of Turkish government.</seg>
<seg id=331> Foreign Minister Abdullah gül recently in Copenhagen decisively the news conference in audiences vyslídil Kurdish journalists, whose then Danes refused guide.</seg>
<seg id=332> Such actions and attitudes my opposition from October 2004 enough to justify.</seg>
<seg id=333> But even if these deficiencies remove, Turkey would still should not be admitted to the EU, because it is the European countries.</seg>
<seg id=334> Christianity, feudalismus, renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization made of US Europeans who we are, but have not made the Turks what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335> Thus, I am convinced that the reforms that have been in Turkey insistence on the European Commission, would continued after his.</seg>
<seg id=336> Rather, I suspect that will uvadat.</seg>
<seg id=337> Turkey's admission would also inevitably led to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338> The first three of these countries are certainly evropštější than Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339> Even if we ponechali three kavkazské Republic, but zahrnuli successor states of the former Yugoslavia, this would mean the creation of the EU, with some Thirty-five members.</seg>
<seg id=340> What it would be for the Union?</seg>
<seg id=341> The EU is simply not club friends.</seg>
<seg id=342> It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and citizens.</seg>
<seg id=343> The Commission, strážce third treaties must these four freedoms, which means that sometimes must member countries talk and in the necessary cases force them to change laws.</seg>
<seg id=344> Protialkoholová policy in Sweden, Volkswagen law in Germany and discrimination foreign investment funds in France are cases that made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345> But were necessary.</seg>
<seg id=346> At a time when I Commission's on the left, I stohu 15 hundred such přestupkových management.</seg>
<seg id=347> Membership in the EU in short, entails to take strong measures that have a profound impact on internal affairs of the state.</seg>
<seg id=348> This will not be possible if the members of the Union become so disparate countries.</seg>
<seg id=349> The EU a victim of what the historian Paul Kennedy called "imperial přesah."</seg>
<seg id=350> The rozředila mistreat.</seg>
<seg id=351> Thus, the former French President Valéry Giscard d, estaing feared that Turkish accession to the EU, and therefore former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey's admission would be more than the EU can bear."</seg>
<seg id=352> The strongest reason against Turkish accession, however, is a genuinely democratic: the majority of the population of the EU it simply wants welfare.</seg>
<seg id=353> Bolivia's crisis, Latin American failures</seg>
<seg id=354> Bolivia is by no latinskoamerickou typical standards.</seg>
<seg id=355> With the exception of Haiti is that the world's poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and into the stability is even worse, because there since independence acts more than two hundreds of upheavals.</seg>
<seg id=356> In the region with a strong indigenous past, but stake and izolovanou present Bolivia is, together with guatemalou perhaps the only latinskoamerickou countries, where indigenous peoples account for the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=357> Its topografie and ethnic rozvrstvení gives rise to autonomistickým, and even odtrženeckým forces that threaten national unity hrozivěji than elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=358> And, of course, is Bolivia, together with paraguayí on the subcontinent also the only nation that has no sea.</seg>
<seg id=359> It would be a be imprudent to extend bolivijskou the current crisis in the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360> Zevšeobecňovat is all too easy: elsewhere are institutions stronger poverty -- and extreme poverty -- is declining, and the battle for natural resources have been largely previously.</seg>
<seg id=361> Even in places like Venezuela, which has a huge reserves of oil and traditionally based nationalist government survived the status quo to foreign investment in energy sources, almost eight years of governance President Hugo Chávez.</seg>
<seg id=362> The existence of indigenous movement is reality in many countries -- from chiapasu over "araucaniu" and amazonii to ayacucho -- but nowhere in Latin America is a real threat to national integrity.</seg>
<seg id=363> Bolivia's crisis is worrying example, and hyped "dominová theory," which in Bolivia representing Johnson and Che Guevara, there are not as platná or even half a reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=364> Yet the current Bolivia's crisis points to the "democratic deficit", which suffers from today's Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=365> In Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti fell from the reason elected leaders.</seg>
<seg id=366> Cuba, in Mexico and Nicaragua democracy is either imperfect or no and in Venezuela, Colombia, from the reason is in danger.</seg>
<seg id=367> None of these cases is not totožný with other; all contain varying degrees of risks damage or reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=368> The question is, what can be done about this condition things that contrasts with the povzbudivou prospect that there is only a few years ago prevailed.</seg>
<seg id=369> At a recent conference Organization of American States (oas) in the fort lauderdale in Florida's leaders of the United States from other a good idea, and then it in its support for potopila.</seg>
<seg id=370> The story began a few years ago, when they were the foreign minister Argentina dante caputo and team of the UN Development Program pověřeni sepsáním news about the state of democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=371> Conclude that system warning democratic crises in the region would help to intervene before the situation gets out of control, as in Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id=372> Caputo and team the UN then convince Chile's President Ricardo Lagos to take the initiative, and with a few colleagues it began to enforce.</seg>
<seg id=373> Lagos did, but initiative is too far reached par with.</seg>
<seg id=374> The report on the state of democracy in Latin America accounts in 2004 about it in fact, barely zmiňovala.</seg>
<seg id=375> The US and the new Secretary-General oas, chilan Jose Miguel insulza, this plan vzkřísili during the conference oas in Florida, but it sunk rational fears Latin American leaders that the idea is directed against Venezuela, joined also anachronický fear latinoameričanů by breaking sacred principle nevměšování.</seg>
<seg id=376> Although the continent's failure to agree on the idea of the concept of an early warning system deserves much attention.</seg>
<seg id=377> The current situation in Bolivia, community western hemisphere many nenadělá, and this situation is dangerous for all.</seg>
<seg id=378> Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and by coca growers, may be an honest, if somewhat dezorientovaný democratic leader, but really in his stoupencích nedřímají authoritarian desires?</seg>
<seg id=379> Hugo Chávez may nefinancuje Morales, and other Bolivia's dissidents, but really do Venezuela and Cuba temptation vměšovat in a country where before almost 40 years ago died Che Guevara, when he be guerilla war?</seg>
<seg id=380> Business community of Santa cruz may undertake these its threat of secession, but really will on oil and gas reserves in the region with rather with indigenous horskými nations than with Brazilian průmyslníky from são Paul?</seg>
<seg id=381> Than events in these excess are reached, not from things, if they began to involved oas (rather than the US).</seg>
<seg id=382> The region will continue to take this engagement -- time, on vyžádání and the proper democratic a platform, which will be different from traditional intervention by the US and from traditional indifference Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=383> The decline of France?</seg>
<seg id=384> The French are proslulí their sensitivity - if not upjatostí - the status of France in the world.</seg>
<seg id=385> The French state invested huge financial investments in promoting the language and culture, but still, the French painfully aware that their countries in the world is not as have been used.</seg>
<seg id=386> So it is no surprise that the news of the European Commission, according to which the level of French economy in comparison with other European countries fell in the ten years are on the tenth place, at the time of the last presidential election soul-searching is and polemiku. Before long, and President Jacques Chirac has accused of his opponent of Lionel Jospin, that has produced, ,úpadek France. "</seg>
<seg id=387> The OECD and eurostat - Europe's body for these data is - believed that this aspect of the debate end, when have shown that France, Germany, Italy, and the UK is roughly the same average living standards of the population.</seg>
<seg id=388> But a broader disputes by were not eliminated.</seg>
<seg id=389> Ustarané discussions about ,úpadku France "again there in the context of letošními protests against pension reform, with's rising disputes about fiscal policy to the European Commission and with hašteřením, with the United States in the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=390> Nejprodávanější book literature fact in France is now polemika Nicolas bavereze called la France qui tombe (declining France).</seg>
<seg id=391> Prošpikována book is citacemi de gaullea and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392> Recent spectacular successes, France, according to autora in the 1970's, when was launched a plant rychlovlaku tgv and plane Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393> Baverez also denounces the mitteranda and Chirac for their has talent vyhrávat elections and change in France outsidera. "</seg>
<seg id=394> The success of the book is itself a sign of particular problems.</seg>
<seg id=395> Her, however, are species?</seg>
<seg id=396> Baverezovy arguments about the decline of the are not so powerful as author believes.</seg>
<seg id=397> For nejkřiklavější evidence, for example, as the French fall in jobs in industry.</seg>
<seg id=398> Deindustrialization is, however, are commonplace in all advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=399> France, in this regard even better than most of its competitors in rich countries and, unlike Germany, Britain or the US, France in the industrial sector to maintain the share of the global market, the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id=400> Also, according to výstižnějšího standards competitiveness, which are foreign investment, France is doing very well.</seg>
<seg id=401> According to a recent report published placebo-controlled Council for economic analysis rose direct investment in France in 2001 to 60 billion euros, which is almost twice as much as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402> Over the past three decades, nákladová also has improved competitiveness France (20%), with higher productivity compensating for rapid growth wages.</seg>
<seg id=403> At the heart of the long-term economic problems France is precisely the fear of job losses in the industrial sector.</seg>
<seg id=404> France remains strong industrial powers in the traditional areas, such as automotive and the airline industry, but lags in markets where smaller businesses are inovacemi with new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=405> On research and development of high-tech, for example, France spends just $30 billion per year, compared to 51 billion in Germany, 98 billion in Japan and 265 billion in the US.</seg>
<seg id=406> In short, the baverezova analysis shows in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407> In the last two decades of France has become vitally important reforms: economic and financial liberalization, by control prices and exchange rates, by credit, the European liberalization, lower inflation and trade deficits, the introduction of the euro and vynucenou globalization domestic firms.</seg>
<seg id=408> The French problems with any of these reforms do.</seg>
<seg id=409> The problem, France is the fact that cannot be part of the new world, which is itself has become.</seg>
<seg id=410> The French state capitalism is dead and France, with his dying only hard vyrovnává.</seg>
<seg id=411> This is not the only country whose Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin - felt obliged to explain away, one day after in television declared that ",stát is not an all-powerful."</seg>
<seg id=412> For the French schizophrenia there are many causes, but it is clear that the key reason to political hrátkami in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=413> Until the 1981 led in France obvious dividing line between the right and left.</seg>
<seg id=414> Since then, however, mitterandova and Chirac's administration otupovaly their ideological are to have an nelehký process of adapting to Europe and globalization.</seg>
<seg id=415> One dose of the "shock therapy" of Margaret Thatcher could twenty years ago to bring about a new political consciousness.</seg>
<seg id=416> The consensual driblování away from the reforms, however, the French to live in a world and to think in a different.</seg>
<seg id=417> This is the key reason for political disaster, which came during the last presidential election campaign, when the leader far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen came to a second round of presidential elections at the expense of the then Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg id=418> Similarly, the rise of the extreme left, these presidential elections received 10% of the vote, the political failure.</seg>
<seg id=419> France needs more political than economic revolution, if it is to come to terms with reality, whose part of an even recognition that, ,úpadek France "is overwhelmed by the French causing themselves.</seg>
<seg id=420> The value of the European values</seg>
<seg id=421> Europe's leaders restore talks on the Constitution, which last December zkrachovaly because of disputes about the voting rights.</seg>
<seg id=422> Similar disputes, of course, are subject to make compromises that are likely to be found.</seg>
<seg id=423> Still, however, is needed a clear understanding of what is the constitution, to achieve.</seg>
<seg id=424> European integration podepírají two basic principles: the Solidarity and subsidiarita.</seg>
<seg id=425> Both the principles of lies at the crossroads philosophy, politics, the economy, sociology and law.</seg>
<seg id=426> For years were present in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in statute, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which is quotes in the preamble to) in the recent of the draft constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427> In short, are vepsány in history and the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=428> But what solidarity and subsidiarita really mean?</seg>
<seg id=429> Consider the first Solidarity, which is open at least two interpretacím: static solidarity is only redistribution of income and wealth, while a broader concept of dynamic solidarity includes their creation.</seg>
<seg id=430> In the postwar history of European integration was dynamic solidarity strong in the first period - in an era of European Coal and Steel Community, both in the strategy of economic development (renewal), and in statute, especially in the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431> But this does not mean that was later dynamic solidarity of: its represents, for example, is the European Monetary Union.</seg>
<seg id=432> So, although some countries should not from the Euro immediate benefits, but the imposed, because they that in the long run, will have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id=433> Dynamic solidarity in other words means upřednostnění policies that supports investment, innovation, economic growth, and employment.</seg>
<seg id=434> But, as the growth of GDP in the EU, it was in the past decade dynamic solidarity podkopána.</seg>
<seg id=435> Particularly worrying is lagging in areas of research and development.</seg>
<seg id=436> The EU, the Lisbon Strategy adopted in 2000, with the promise of a nejkonkurenceschopnější economies in the world, threatened by increasing emphasis on image solidarity, which is reflected in the high cost of social security, and high taxes needed to finance.</seg>
<seg id=437> Ascendancy of static solidarity is due to aging populations that, when combined with but growth led and leads to structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
<seg id=438> One of the greatest tasks for the future of the EU is addressing today's too much static solidarity aimed at the old people over a dynamic solidarity number young people.</seg>
<seg id=439> After all, the Union cannot afford to continue to enable to the current consumption prevailed over investment needed to ensure the future prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=440> Subsidiarita, the concept of solidarity is that it has two interpretation: vertical subsidiaritu and horizontální subsidiaritu.</seg>
<seg id=441> Vertical subsidiarita lies in the distribution of power at different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU national states, regions, and samosprávné community.</seg>
<seg id=442> The applications of this principle is federalist.</seg>
<seg id=443> In European treaties are clear statement vertical of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=444> But it is the obsáhnutí vyvstávajícího institutional and constitutional arrangements Union?</seg>
<seg id=445> Horizontální subsidiarita lies in the responsibility and freedom of people, as well as in the social and economic power.</seg>
<seg id=446> Includes relations between the state, companies and market.</seg>
<seg id=447> Society and the market, but they own rights and sovereignty that state nepropůjčuje.</seg>
<seg id=448> The problem is the cause of autonomy, each of these empire.</seg>
<seg id=449> Horizontální example of subsidiarity is internal European market, which produced a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms that eliminoval protections provided the national governments.</seg>
<seg id=450> Horizontální subsidiarita means that in society or in the economic sphere, the state cannot disrupt freedom and responsibility of the individual, which must be respektovány in the highest possible,.</seg>
<seg id=451> Also, this means that where freedom and individual responsibility nepostačují for achieving goals necessary for human dignity must support to provide a "becomes power."</seg>
<seg id=452> But this support should be done in ways that foster natural potential of the individual, society and market.</seg>
<seg id=453> But this is possible only if it is the role of horizontální of subsidiarity clearly formulována, which is not the case of European treaties of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and activities of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454> In short, solidarity mean more redistribution than growth (which is the way they today's generation expressing their solidarity with generations the next), while subsidiarita began to mean more redistribution political power than timid drawing borders between the state, civil society and market.</seg>
<seg id=455> Today, both values defined in ways that favor state.</seg>
<seg id=456> Concentration in market-oriented "growth is often associated with a cizorodými values America.</seg>
<seg id=457> These values are, however, they are so deeply rooted in Europe, and they should be vytaženy again to light.</seg>
<seg id=458> The EU should to restore its economic vitality drive for such a model of solidarity and of subsidiarity, which would be vyváženější in favor of the market and society and who would snižoval sociálně-ekonomický state.</seg>
<seg id=459> State institutions should provide public goods (such as defense, justice, fiscal and monetary policy), society should provide the goods social (for example, culture, education, and help those people) and market should provide the goods economic (which dealt with profits, growth and employment).</seg>
<seg id=460> In the 21st century Europe needs reconsider the value of both these principles - of solidarity and of subsidiarity - if it is to achieve historical goals integration: freedom and wellbeing needed to overcome differences and political rozkolů that in the 20th century, tragedy.</seg>
<seg id=461> Such is the spirit in which must be the European constitution written.</seg>
<seg id=462> Politics of values</seg>
<seg id=463> The debate about the American election has neustala.</seg>
<seg id=464> Both President George W. Bush managed to three million votes more than senátorovi John Kerry and návdavkem to achieve the majority of the Republicans in both houses of Congress?</seg>
<seg id=465> In the answers not the agreement, but many explanations are refer back to the same two issues.</seg>
<seg id=466> One is a question of personality.</seg>
<seg id=467> At a time of uncertainty and risk should people greater confidence in the president, which they know, than in the candidate who are neodzkoušeně.</seg>
<seg id=468> The second issue are values.</seg>
<seg id=469> People voted for sadu values rather than for a specific policy.</seg>
<seg id=470> Some (as we say) may have with Kerry's policy, but still gave voice Bush, because it is his general attitudes doing so with a sense of calm.</seg>
<seg id=471> If it is a way to vote, are now the United States clearly deeply divided.</seg>
<seg id=472> Modrých arch (democratic) countries to the East, the North, and the West spans a red (Republican) area in the midst of and in the South.</seg>
<seg id=473> Even more, these divisions, they create and local level.</seg>
<seg id=474> účelové division of electoral districts in them should favor a political party, is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id=475> People they tend to move to areas in which the majority shares their values, whatever the Republican, or democratic.</seg>
<seg id=476> What values precisely this is?</seg>
<seg id=477> For those that -- as claims -- are related to the "God, weapons and gay."</seg>
<seg id=478> Its role in them, religion, including doslovné biblické truth, if it is a story of creation.</seg>
<seg id=479> Possessed weapons is the ultimate test individualism and the use of weapons in wars is reprehensible.</seg>
<seg id=480> Homosexuality, and other "modern" practices are odmítány as nevázané.</seg>
<seg id=481> As hacker Andrew political scientist recently put it, "the Bush kandidatura was focus on profit majority vote by providing roughly 60 million people the chance to have for a good sense of".</seg>
<seg id=482> All of this is America's phenomenon, or similar trends exist elsewhere?</seg>
<seg id=483> One answer is that the politics of values as America's phenomenon may now be a majority, but in no case is universal.</seg>
<seg id=484> Europe and other parts of the world are dispersed as much.</seg>
<seg id=485> On personality undoubtedly matters and under external political differences can be also questions values that even nevystoupily to the fore.</seg>
<seg id=486> Traditional political divisions, based on the dispute about the basic values, however, elections in a smaller role.</seg>
<seg id=487> For example, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, other major official by waiting elections, while plays personal card and talk about political strategies, but in fact represents hodnotovou above all sadu middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488> When talk about "modernization," the "přenesení things in the twenty-first century," he has sugerovat strange, but tempting a mixture of change and stability.</seg>
<seg id=489> Conservative opposition is without effective answers.</seg>
<seg id=490> Even questions such as tax cuts or tighter azylová rules not quite on the value struny that touches the Republican side in the US.</seg>
<seg id=491> A similar picture exists in Germany, where it is external influence value policies even lower.</seg>
<seg id=492> The debate is still largely debate about political strategies.</seg>
<seg id=493> When the opposition offers government talks about reform health or the a struggle with unemployment, then the hidden competition to kompetentnosti rather than values.</seg>
<seg id=494> Under be evolving along customary fighting political debate in Britain, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, however, are fraught with value conflict.</seg>
<seg id=495> Parties are fighting for those that can be induced to "for had a good sense of", however, may be fully do not realize that it is only part of the policy.</seg>
<seg id=496> Religion is likely to happen an important factor in the European policy; public opinion polls show that religious practices, one of the few large differences between the Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497> Also weapons are in the minds of Europeans different place; most Europeans regarded as an important their lack of.</seg>
<seg id=498> It is also in Europe nezaměnitelný and a feature of pacifism.</seg>
<seg id=499> But there is also has podceňovanou role the issue of political correctness (homosexuals).</seg>
<seg id=500> From the most important, however, is the fact that Europeans divides Europe itself, as in any European state of a "national question."</seg>
<seg id=501> It is a matter of values inspirovanou fear.</seg>
<seg id=502> People want to know where is due, and are reverting against the US and toward Europe, or Europe and towards their country.</seg>
<seg id=503> Either way, abandon empire political strategy, and even policies and enter kalné spheres of symbols and myth.</seg>
<seg id=504> This is in any case, the main the risk that the democratic countries face for the politics of values is a dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=505> Again, brings the fundamental divisions in societies, whose the greatest democratic success is excluded fundamentalism of politics.</seg>
<seg id=506> After public debate must be sporem about political strategy in the community of values.</seg>
<seg id=507> Insist, therefore, is the main goal of policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508> Nadchází age payments</seg>
<seg id=509> One vlaštovka spring does and one month normal growth, the number of jobs and rising prices in the United States doesn't mean that America's central bank continues to worries economic problems, and deflation.</seg>
<seg id=510> But a time when the world's interest rates will rise, because the central bankers will be preparing to fight the rising inflation.</seg>
<seg id=511> Whether this moment will ever - this autumn, in 2005, in 2006, or in 2007 - will be, America and the global economy face financial zranitelností, which reflects the success monetárních incentives in stifling downturn and reining in unemployment in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id=512> Short-term interest rates are astonishingly low: just 2% in the euro area, only 1% in the US and nula in Japan.</seg>
<seg id=513> An expansionary monetary policy was successful, but only that pushed interest rates on historical wages, and that appears investors that the cost of borrowing remain on the current level of a long time.</seg>
<seg id=514> The result monetárního stimulus was an increase in asset prices: if interest rates very low and očekává-li that very low remain, then everything is a a dividend or rentu, atraktivnějším - and hence in the currency expression of cennějším.</seg>
<seg id=515> This explains the differences between the current real estate prices in the US stocks in New York, London, and Frankfurt and long-term bonds around the world with what one would normally regarded as their fundamental value.</seg>
<seg id=516> So what will happen when central banks begin to raise interest rates?</seg>
<seg id=517> In 1994, rising Short-term rates also growth rates long-term - and the fall in the price of long-term bonds, which was at least twice as large compared to what at the time předpovídaly standard models.</seg>
<seg id=518> Interest rates from developing economies in the world, the growing faster than the rates in the developed the industrial core.</seg>
<seg id=519> The first danger, we should be to fear for 2005 and further in the future, when the rise of the world's interest rates will most likely - is, another rash of financial crises in the so-called new economies.</seg>
<seg id=520> On countries, such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the balance of the 1990's shows that interest rates can expand and flow of capital are remarkably quickly turn, no matter how favorably perceive economic policy of the countries of the leaders of the IMF and analysis big banks.</seg>
<seg id=521> Interest rates in the new economies is now abnormálně low.</seg>
<seg id=522> The International Monetary flows - from the flow of financial resources to the US - even nedosáhly levels, with talking about "irrational exuberance", but still occur before began growth interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=523> But this is an alarming, because if the prospect of the 1990's is a lesson, it is the realization that, no one should exaggerate the stability of the international financial flows.</seg>
<seg id=524> A second danger stems from high asset prices within the first industrial core.</seg>
<seg id=525> In America's central bank clearly been dominated by view - that I agree - that the revolution of information technology continues, the growth rate of potential output in the US remains very high, and if gap is relatively wide.</seg>
<seg id=526> This implies that interest rates they may have to remain low for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=527> Confidence in the central bank is, moreover, high and last residual bonuses for inflation risk in the 1970's have been of interest rates vyždímány.</seg>
<seg id=528> As a result, remain interest rates on the state of the 1980's and 1990's low even after the performance return on their potential.</seg>
<seg id=529> All of this is, of course, the good news for those who their assets as long-term bonds, stocks or real estate.</seg>
<seg id=530> The long-term asset price was, after all, a reason to reduce interest rates: enrich holders of bonds and, above all, owners real estate after all stimulates an their expenditures.</seg>
<seg id=531> The bad news is that, even though assumes that interest rates will remain even some low, nezůstanou such low indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id=532> The bottom line is that the rise of interest rates will fall asset prices.</seg>
<seg id=533> It is in such periods, particularly if asset prices fall quickly and - how well our central bankers fulfills its main task: reducing financial rozkolísanosti and support for economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534> In such periods also will show how many owners of long-term bonds, real estate or stocks is are not because they take their current prices for attractive relative prices to the fundamental, but simply because their price increases in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id=535> This is a key question for economic planners, because those who long-term assets asked because their price in a seemingly without ustání, is short immediately after the price trend will proselytize.</seg>
<seg id=536> Especially in the future, the US trade deficit is a potential source of huge instability, if there is a serious decline in the long-term asset price.</seg>
<seg id=537> The key America will face the world economy over the next few years, will certainly different from the problems that by the NASDAQ in the aftermath of a bubble.</seg>
<seg id=538> The risks associated with inflation are less likely to a dangerous than risks stemming from the collapse of performance, and threats of deflation.</seg>
<seg id=539> But as we poučili in the 1990's, all of this does not mean that the challenges will manage easily.</seg>
<seg id=540> Mixed America's Future</seg>
<seg id=541> I recently discovered anything interesting: the American economists of international finance and American economists inclined to domestic economy are very different -- indeed, contradictory -- views on to the consequences of the US current-account deficit.</seg>
<seg id=542> Economists of international finance for life as financial crisis, which will follow painful, and perhaps more permanent recession in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=543> Macroeconomists focus on domestic economy, nepohlížejí on the dollar's value as a crisis, but as an opportunity to faster growth.</seg>
<seg id=544> Macroeconomists inclined to domestic economy to see this situation: at some point in the future of foreign central banks begin to be less prepared to continue to buy enormous amounts of dollar-denominated securities and reinforce as America's currency.</seg>
<seg id=545> To end its massive programs purchase of dollars, the value of the dollar will fall -- and will fall sharply.</seg>
<seg id=546> According to this view, however, when the value of the dollar will be to foreigners, will be more attractive American export goods and in the US will rise employment, with the labor force will přesměrována to the newly oživeného export sector.</seg>
<seg id=547> It will be a type of what happened in the UK after abandoned the peg the exchange rate and kept the pound decline in relation to the Deutsche Mark, or what happened in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar depreciated to the pound, the Deutsche Mark and, above all, the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg id=548> Economists of international finance future much pochmurněji.</seg>
<seg id=549> Are convinced that the end of the new programs central banks to buy dollars will not only the decline of the dollar, but also to a sharp increase in the US long-term interest rates, which immediately will curb consumer spending and with small zpožděním squeezing exporters valve investment spending.</seg>
<seg id=550> Of course, economists of international finance also understand that reducing the value of the dollar will vývozům the US, but prodlevy demand such that export growth will only a year or two after the decline in the market and investment spending.</seg>
<seg id=551> Eight to 10 million people will have to change jobs and move of services and construction into its export goods and goods konkurujícího imports, which means that the structural unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=552> Moreover, can be financial panic: large financial institutions with short-run pasivy and long-term assets economies difficult, and will have to deal with large the dollar long-term interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=553> This inappropriate links can trigger financial tensions and bankruptcies just as much as it is in Mexican and East Asia's crisis in the 1990's, and in Argentina's crisis in the current decade was caused by assets banks in local currency and liabilities in dollars.</seg>
<seg id=554> When economists of international finance načrtnou this scenario, macroeconomists focus on domestic economy are that it is as a failure of monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555> Why should the Federal Reserve afford to long-term interest rates vylétly only because the other central banks to put an end to their programs buy dollars?</seg>
<seg id=556> Should the Fed acting and replace it is their purchases long-term government bonds, the US, thereby long-term interest rates maintain at the level of allowing full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557> On this economists of international finance to that it is not the Fed this.</seg>
<seg id=558> If the Fed have to choose between a full employment and price stability, economists of international finance say that chooses to price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970's, when inflation spin out of control, is still very vividly.</seg>
<seg id=559> Thus, given that the decline in the value of the dollar increases import prices and thus as adverse shock for the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to raise interest rates rather than reduce, and bonds, not buy.</seg>
<seg id=560> This debate, find themselves on either pólech strongly vyhraněné views serious economists, of which the extremely vážím.</seg>
<seg id=561> I am not so moudrý me to say, who is right, but certainly not know who hope that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id=562> Black pasažéři Europe</seg>
<seg id=563> In the United States must individual countries that follow unsound fiscal policy, pay a price.</seg>
<seg id=564> Compared to better spravovaným states their bonds sell the at their discount windows.</seg>
<seg id=565> The higher the debt service, must up, the -- to some extent -- as a form of kázeňského measures against the temptation to spend now and pay to the next.</seg>
<seg id=566> To be sure, market discipline is not perfect: the bond market too well "see" implicit future liabilities (přislíbené payouts pensions).</seg>
<seg id=567> But this forced fiscal discipline, together with the internal budget procedures of individual states, from the US since the Great Depression of a large fiscal crisis.</seg>
<seg id=568> Now look at Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569> Before the advent of the euro in individual national states in southern Europe vyskytlo many fiscal crisis that incited waves of high inflation.</seg>
<seg id=570> After the introduction of the single currency, however, to solve fiscal crisis through inflation closed, for over the monetary policy now hold sentinels the European Central Bank (ECB).</seg>
<seg id=571> But, while for national states cannot in a solution to their nevyvážených finance rely on inflation, the single currency them allows for extending expenditure dýchánků and to odsouvání political responsibility for a period of laissez a wood bons temps roulés use debt capacity, which properly's other members of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=572> To this possibility ahead of an, the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits should be less than 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573> Last week, the government in Germany - once fiscally nejrozvážnější and the most disciplined EU countries -- about fiscal exposure to violate the pact's rules for fifth year, and did so without (many) apologies.</seg>
<seg id=574> Finance Minister peer steinbrück suggested that the expected to the European Commission applies to Germany some sanctions: if taken steps, he said, the credibility of the Pact will be imperilled.</seg>
<seg id=575> Germany, this time will not be sanctions blocking, as did two and a half years.</seg>
<seg id=576> Steinbrück but also made clear that expected to sanctions behind předpokládaný fiscal deficit Germany of 3.4% of GDP will largely symbolic that they on the, which would the government or economy paid a greater price.</seg>
<seg id=577> The Stability and Growth Pact works -- at least for now -- as had originally been intended.</seg>
<seg id=578> And what about a market disciplinou?</seg>
<seg id=579> Is the willingness to the German government more debt and be running trade more public deficits limited, because market rozeznává and pokutuje national states that allow to their fiscal position slábla?</seg>
<seg id=580> In one word, not.</seg>
<seg id=581> Interest rates in sovereign debt in euros twelve governments of the euro area are all very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582> So it seems that markets, whose that individual countries have different potenciály produce exports and shade and financial flows needed to repaying debt or different common and odhadované circumstances of the debt relative to GDP.</seg>
<seg id=583> Willem buiter from amsterodamské universities and Anne sibertová of London believe that this was a willingness to the ECB to in the nature of the debt the euro as zajištěný what it a willingness to markets operate as vymahač fiscal prudence.</seg>
<seg id=584> If maržová part of the German debt using as a guarantee of the short-term loans or as the main point of the buy to gain liquidity, its value will be more likely to determine the conditions under which it as a guarantee of the ECB will than according to the fundamental indicators.</seg>
<seg id=585> The ECB's approach to all such debt repudiation as equally solid resources reserve liquidity now triumphed over every analysis difference in the long sovereign at risk.</seg>
<seg id=586> This is the long-term dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=587> To create a decent hope for long-term price stability is needed as market discipline and reasonable fiscal management.</seg>
<seg id=588> Vynechte either market on the for the behavior of that can prostoupit what makes, or institutional leverage that propůjčují voice future generations, and you seriously risk -- may not now nor tomorrow, but once and for the rest of life.</seg>
<seg id=589> As it is time, the emergence of the single currency and the way in which the Euro was introduced, is increasingly unrest.</seg>
<seg id=590> Overall, policies over the eurozónou too deflationary.</seg>
<seg id=591> Without appropriate transferům that would have a common currency snesitelnější for regions that prodělávají and are already in recession when the ECB zpřísňuje policy.</seg>
<seg id=592> The institutional foundations for a stable long-term fiscal policies are rozleptávány.</seg>
<seg id=593> And this buiter and sibertová compelling argue that the ECB gives market managerial hospodárných and punishing marnotratných less than space should.</seg>
<seg id=594> This does not sesuv land, and even some time.</seg>
<seg id=595> But if no true, underlying under the euro can be put into motion.</seg>
<seg id=596> Milosevic and Hussein: the Court as fraška</seg>
<seg id=597> Trials were once serious enterprise.</seg>
<seg id=598> The hermana to recall the göringa and rudolfa hesse, as mrzutě are in the dock at Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg id=599> Some nacističtí there were even after a relatively short, but fair decisions oběšeni.</seg>
<seg id=600> Today, the proceedings against nejničemnějším world leaders turned into a a farce.</seg>
<seg id=601> The trial of Saddam Hussein and his baasistickými servants provides a constant sequence trapností.</seg>
<seg id=602> Doing zkoušejí one taškařici for the second and Hussein has flaunted all possible forms of contempt, beyond the vystrkování holého zadku to judge.</seg>
<seg id=603> Hardly expect the outcome, which will in the eyes of Iraqis and world seen as legitimate.</seg>
<seg id=604> Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, after four years nudných reports and after exhaustion of more than $200 million on spending into a pohřeb.</seg>
<seg id=605> In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government has almost ten years dohadují, before the Court to countenance because of the Khmer Rouge.</seg>
<seg id=606> Masoví vrazi who came to power in the twentieth century condemned to be either killed in people's following, or tried for their crimes -- that is, if nezemřeli in power.</seg>
<seg id=607> Who can be proud of the Communist leader Romania nikolae ceauşescu and his wife, were executed by without sebemenšího of fair process?</seg>
<seg id=608> Formal dangers real court seem always better than immediate justice, even if the end result was also death.</seg>
<seg id=609> Today, there are two viable ways to act against svrženému rebel against a tyrant.</seg>
<seg id=610> Its former leaders could before the Court pohnat himself a nation, as they did in the 1980's, Argentines with generals accountable for the disappearance of more than $5,000 fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id=611> Internationally, for the other processes around norimberský model, while for dubious conditions, with the victorious powers sometimes introduce a responsible for crimes, for example, "crimes against humanity," which were in their a properly defined narrowly.</seg>
<seg id=612> Were times, when we could see the benefits of both national and international tribunals processes.</seg>
<seg id=613> Domestic trials to local community to the near participation vypořádalo its hořem.</seg>
<seg id=614> As the judges and porotci could krajané obžalovaného turn out to be more exist for assessing blame for were aware of the hard conditions in which sesazený dictator't their decisions.</seg>
<seg id=615> Argentina's process with generals was the ritual of in bolestivém transition from military junta to democracy, experience, however, ended plačtivým lack of hubris.</seg>
<seg id=616> Even after the conviction were generals so powerful that the necessary to end processes and then at from nastoupivšího president.</seg>
<seg id=617> Argentina's policy is to the consequences of the processes of 20 years ago still zapletena.</seg>
<seg id=618> Internationally, the UN Security Council's decision establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also přivítáno with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619> The ICTY truly under the leadership of antonia casseseho made important decisions.</seg>
<seg id=620> But then should judges -- that they was realized their greatest dream -- to try to his animal is held down arcilumpa Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621> It is not clear how would in local process with Milosevic naložili Serbs.</seg>
<seg id=622> A lot of would záviselo on which political party, the Court dominate.</seg>
<seg id=623> On the international level so fear of přemíry policies, but from přemíry rights.</seg>
<seg id=624> Milosevic's trial had to be more than just, had to be emblémem justice the UN.</seg>
<seg id=625> Milosevic because he himself was allowed to defend -- which was given a and the effectiveness of the court a huge mistake.</seg>
<seg id=626> Not limited, not even the number of witnesses that prosecutor předvolával to testimony about one, and the same horrific history of the Serbian aggression and brutality.</seg>
<seg id=627> Take many months before it stated, what went wrong and why process has lasted scandalous four years.</seg>
<seg id=628> My suspect is that the officials with good intentions too affecting South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a model of corporate vychvalovaný fakultách as desirable alternative to odvetné justice.</seg>
<seg id=629> In the Southern African negotiations was not the most important question of the future obžalovaného, but the past.</seg>
<seg id=630> All victims were led to vyprávěly their story and obžalovaný listened.</seg>
<seg id=631> In the case of massacres vytrpěných in the twentieth century would such story stories could take decades.</seg>
<seg id=632> Povzbuzovat victims to hovořily, and then be obžalovanému right to obstruct negotiations vychvalováním their merit in the position of the political leader is a recipe for endless delaying.</seg>
<seg id=633> One lesson that we from processes with Milosevic and Hussein odnesli is that it is not well build a man or a woman before the Court to skoncovali with their charismatickou přitažlivostí.</seg>
<seg id=634> Doing process překroutí -- especially if the possibility of defending the by themselves -- and the courtroom use to justifying of his career.</seg>
<seg id=635> Tyrants should be tried only when they are clearly beaten.</seg>
<seg id=636> It is ironic that advantage of the Nuremberg judicial tribunals is their fill the leaders victorious powers.</seg>
<seg id=637> They were göringovi, hessovi and their pomahačům constant reminder that control have in the hands of the allies, and that the Nazis were its beaten.</seg>
<seg id=638> Goal process was always punishment culprit, not the way in which will psány history.</seg>
<seg id=639> Tragedy Milosevic and husajnova process is that the details of history, even neusadily and trial before the history.</seg>
<seg id=640> The resulting hesitation responsible people to create a procedures -- as international and national -- that nahrávaly fantaziím to strip guilt and return.</seg>
<seg id=641> In the case of Hussein, this may yet readily zhmotnit.</seg>
<seg id=642> Economic division of the Iraq</seg>
<seg id=643> Anyone who looked on Iraq, see the state divided on the community Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=644> As the fundamental dělítkem -- which contributed to probíhajícímu insurgency as much as sectarian půtky and resistance to the US-led military occupation -- is deepening gap between rich and poor Iraqis.</seg>
<seg id=645> After the liberation of Iraq, most people, especially those of the poor, hope for a charismatic leader who defend the is a bitter reality everyday life.</seg>
<seg id=646> These people were bred in fear, and therefore idea about how to on their society to democracy or how could human rights groups and civil society organizations help shape the future.</seg>
<seg id=647> Iraq so soon faced new social of division.</seg>
<seg id=648> On the one hand, with people who understand how work in democracy, power and to implement their ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=649> Learned talk the language of democracy, made it, money, and secure their rights and power to defend the independent organizations.</seg>
<seg id=650> On the other hand, however, remains a huge population powerless Iraqis, including vdov and rozvedených or left women who have anyone who would did them and their children.</seg>
<seg id=651> For these people democracy and human rights are nothing.</seg>
<seg id=652> Are neinformovaní, poor and disease-ridden.</seg>
<seg id=653> They victims of educational system, which is more than a decade ago collapsed, and are little qualified to in zničeném Iraqi economy found employment.</seg>
<seg id=654> In Saddam's government was not vynaloženo no effort to increase vitally levels of the poor.</seg>
<seg id=655> I traveled huge Iraqi slumy and found in families living in the home, which have barely roof are zamořeny ubiquitous hmyzem and pode doors them neředěné prosakují splašky.</seg>
<seg id=656> In the days and nights live in temnotě.</seg>
<seg id=657> Although little nothing more than food, a decent home, and the possibility of a job, waiting for these families to death and the tears of their hungry children.</seg>
<seg id=658> When I met with women, which in these obydlích live, covered me questions: the US democracy food and homes?</seg>
<seg id=659> Democracy is to men bili their manželky?</seg>
<seg id=660> Can our children citizenship?</seg>
<seg id=661> Give us the right rozvést with husband, the US will end?</seg>
<seg id=662> My the answer to all these questions was "Yes".</seg>
<seg id=663> Yes, democracy, you can bydlet right in slušném house, the right to learn and work, it will vašim children citizenship and you to the status of your men.</seg>
<seg id=664> But you need to work hard and make any possible efforts to require their rights.</seg>
<seg id=665> Women in: "Saddam US 35 years taught as be unemployed, do not remain silent for and ustrašené.</seg>
<seg id=666> What Now we can do? "</seg>
<seg id=667> In these professional areas, where the majority of Iraqis, people are becoming prey for trpkých temptation.</seg>
<seg id=668> Many of them beyond the reach of political or government leaders.</seg>
<seg id=669> Easily, letting the drive to violence, krádežím and sabotážím.</seg>
<seg id=670> Poverty drives some of them to accept money for acts, ponoukáni vábničkou an heroism, which in Saddam's long government could not be released.</seg>
<seg id=671> Poverty also rozjitřila trauma Iraqi violent past wars and atrocities that made people less citlivými against the killings.</seg>
<seg id=672> Although conditions in today's Iraq attract many young men to violence, I believe that they just to provide a decent job and housing, to be saved.</seg>
<seg id=673> Particularly employment will help young people based new lives by serious work.</seg>
<seg id=674> Jobs, we need to create artificially, only to zamaskovali army unemployed.</seg>
<seg id=675> We must give people do, which would allow them to contribute to rebuild the country.</seg>
<seg id=676> An individual to have from its nature prove to be a useful member of society.</seg>
<seg id=677> Culture created by Saddam, however, Iraqis appears that the only way to the authority, power, and the knowledge, are political connections.</seg>
<seg id=678> To overcome such sentiments will require time and prosperous economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must be limited power to enable private-sector growth and nourish general understanding of human rights and democracy.</seg>
<seg id=679> Religious groups are prepared to contribute to this process.</seg>
<seg id=680> We can also rehabilitovat technocrats, who served under Saddam that they have an opportunity to serve their country.</seg>
<seg id=681> Last but not least, we must provide loans poor families, they have helped to establish obstojný life.</seg>
<seg id=682> Above all, however, the government must from all forces try to persuade poor Iraqis about the value of democracy and freedom and about how it is for implementing the their desire for a better life important constitution.</seg>
<seg id=683> In a country where many people consider violations of law as a heroism, this will not be easy.</seg>
<seg id=684> We Iraqis, we have learned, but also that power should not be focus in a few hands, and that the building of justice requires struggle with all forms of corruption.</seg>
<seg id=685> If the Constitution is to function as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, it must poor Iraqis to take this struggle for its.</seg>
<seg id=686> Islámistická Identity</seg>
<seg id=687> Anywhere else is now the Islam is used (and has) as a political force.</seg>
<seg id=688> Some Muslims him use as call to action; many people in the West (and elsewhere) him, as, ,něco else "and demand his restrictions and rejection of the.</seg>
<seg id=689> I as turek, I directly empathy in both sides in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=690> The reason why the Islam in the eyes of seems religion, ,jiného "is the fact that the West is now witnessed a systematic deinstitucionalizace religion.</seg>
<seg id=691> From the modern Western life, of course, nevymizelo itself religion, but rather claims that can religious institutions placed on life of the individual.</seg>
<seg id=692> Religion in the modern world is far more than ever before personal and spiritual prožitkem.</seg>
<seg id=693> The process of deinstitucionalizace religious experience, however, takes place also within Islam.</seg>
<seg id=694> The politicization of Islam is weakening the authority of the Islamic religious classes, the so-called ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695> As in the case of the West, and Islamic religious experience a osobnějším.</seg>
<seg id=696> One of the results of the is a matter of religious texts individual Muslims, including political radicals, intellectuals and women.</seg>
<seg id=697> The second is the vulgarizace religious knowledge, the abuse of the teachings of the Koran and vytrhávání certain the part of the context in order to support for political aims.</seg>
<seg id=698> What is to determine who now in Islam legitimate, and what unlawful?</seg>
<seg id=699> Who is authority construed religious texts?</seg>
<seg id=700> Who can go, ,fatvu "or to declare, ,džihád?"</seg>
<seg id=701> Activism and terrorism today, or more vnucují - a new source of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=702> What about Islam mean, and does not mean, so they laikové without religious authority schools and specialized training.</seg>
<seg id=703> Islam is now vykládán mainly political agents and cultural hnutími, not religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=704> This deinstitucionalizace allowed to Islam cease to be only local and national social glue and began to participate in the shaping imaginary bonds among all Muslims who everywhere feel utlačováni or expelled.</seg>
<seg id=705> Islámismus now can to equalize supporters, which previously existed deep divisions: the spiritual sufie and vysvěcené advocates of šaríi, Shia, Sunnis, and Conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg id=706> At the same time, it is the Islam in motion, because its religious abandon rural areas and goes to cities, including cities in the West.</seg>
<seg id=707> Many people consider the Movement for something wrong and highlight the fact that these Muslims are the social vykořeněni, leading to the estrangement and in some cases to terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708> Social mobility, however, is also a condition of creating a modern worldview.</seg>
<seg id=709> Muslims through migration, of course, are experiencing a sense of and, if not downright seceding from their welfare of origin.</seg>
<seg id=710> Their religious experience so picks up the new character, zbavený theological, social or state institutions.</seg>
<seg id=711> Becoming a form of social readily, in which the Muslims again with a sense of belonging to Islam in the new and foreign environment.</seg>
<seg id=712> A return to the religious identity is not podněcován odloučeností from modern life, but his blízkostí.</seg>
<seg id=713> Most radicalism appears within the groups that the experience with mobility and by shifting into a new environment witnessed secular political thinking and městský life of the West.</seg>
<seg id=714> In neznámém environment, neorientují, and their anchor, indeed, is becoming Islam.</seg>
<seg id=715> But if this kotva work, it must be Islam in the face of modernity free from its traditionally ponížených, pasivních and obedient positions.</seg>
<seg id=716> Nošením veils of or plnovousu, attention to the right to modlitebny in employment or in schools and požadováním special food Muslims on the identifikují as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=717> Telling everyone around them, they are in their religious obyčejích zanícenější and more anxious about than those who its religiosity on private life.</seg>
<seg id=718> Nemuslimové, for example, they see in the wearing veils of speech humiliation and podřazenosti Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719> But for the Muslims of the former stigmatu became a positive confirmation of Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=720> This transformation perfectly ilustrují young muslimky.</seg>
<seg id=721> Girls, which in the French and German schools nosí šátek, have in many ways (notably in culture youth, the perception of fashion or language) closer to its spolužačkám than to its domáckým nevzdělaným mothers.</seg>
<seg id=722> Nošením her veil in the public sphere these girls unwittingly changing symbol and the role of the Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=723> But this tendency runs deeper than the šátkům.</seg>
<seg id=724> All Western Muslims today feel double belonging, double cultural capital.</seg>
<seg id=725> Define themselves through their those found, but also a universal, secular knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=726> And because they are double cultural capital can the relatively free to move between different in activities and prostředími - home, lessons, mládežnickými alliances or urban centers for free time.</seg>
<seg id=727> To be a Muslim and be islámistou is not the same thing.</seg>
<seg id=728> Currently, we see a shift away from Muslim identity to identity islámistické.</seg>
<seg id=729> Religious I among Muslims přesunuje from private sphere to the public.</seg>
<seg id=730> The question for all remains whether can be that the search for identity satisfy šátky and by adopting islámistických religious practice wide public support, or whether positive confirmation of Islam requires fundamentálnější surrender of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731> A new era for Islamic science?</seg>
<seg id=732> When natural science and mathematics enjoyed několikasetletému period of great inventions, čněla one area world above all others.</seg>
<seg id=733> Mistři these disciplín there were uctíváni, medicine were making rapid development and the average citizen, preoccupied how nature works.</seg>
<seg id=734> It is no surprise that this region sklízela around the world respect.</seg>
<seg id=735> In the second half of the poznané planet were so far scientists punished, even killed.</seg>
<seg id=736> The mathematics was based outside the law as a Godless and cizorodá discipline and later serve religious purposes.</seg>
<seg id=737> Living standards was low.</seg>
<seg id=738> The prosperous regions was Islamic Middle East, while ignorant Europe's poor.</seg>
<seg id=739> Both the were religiously command (historians in this context rozcházejí in view of the role and nature of religion), but science boom only one of them.</seg>
<seg id=740> Today, the role of Islamic Middle East and West turned the.</seg>
<seg id=741> After World War II, foolproof of to become the United States.</seg>
<seg id=742> During this period after nejbystřejší students from their countries, because it is attracted the better research universities and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=743> Until recently, they more than half of the postgraduálních students mathematics natural sciences and engineering in the US people birth abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744> Many of these talent after the completion of the study in the United States, which, mined industry and governance.</seg>
<seg id=745> Islamic culture, meanwhile, joined the historical phase in which was položeno links between science and Western influence, and society, science vyhýbala.</seg>
<seg id=746> Even in countries where oil revenues could support a huge amount of research, Arab rulers such investment nestimulovali, their society neprosperují as could.</seg>
<seg id=747> The desire for greater political recognition recently encourages Islamic states to invest in technology, which is most reflected in nuclear ambitions Pakistan and Iran.</seg>
<seg id=748> Nuclear weapons bear a political clout, but their scientific basis for it uninspiring and old.</seg>
<seg id=749> Greater is recognition of stemming from cultivate pronikavých ideas rather than from products earlier discovery.</seg>
<seg id=750> Imagine how would receive the Pakistani Institute, which would lead to global research cancer.</seg>
<seg id=751> And, would political rhetoric a shift, if ománští scientists objevili key to AIDS?</seg>
<seg id=752> This is one nevyužitá opportunity.</seg>
<seg id=753> But there is another, and not only for Islamic society.</seg>
<seg id=754> The US has recently at Kyoto deep mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=755> At the level of a government, from the president here, have been science "questions faith."</seg>
<seg id=756> Political operatives changing news Top scientists, if the facts into conflict with official faith.</seg>
<seg id=757> Also schools, povzbuzeny religiously ovlivněnou administration move gravity of from science to "values."</seg>
<seg id=758> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 are entrance visa vydávána less and obtížněji, shánějí, which is weakening the flow of young talent to American universities.</seg>
<seg id=759> Major scientific organization against miserably protest.</seg>
<seg id=760> At the same time were tax laws upraveny to investors bohatli in the short run, which is when from long-term investments in research.</seg>
<seg id=761> On the war in Iraq was vyčleněno half a trillion dollars, which is the amount that some amounts to support the basic research in the last 1,000 years.</seg>
<seg id=762> Even if the US avoided a fundamentalist years, they risk losing global domination in areas of research.</seg>
<seg id=763> Japan pochopilo link between political influence and science in the 1980's, the last century.</seg>
<seg id=764> The main Japanese industrialist who managed and Chairman society Sony akio morita then, together with pravicovým politician šintarem išiharou gave many speeches, which in 1986 publikovali in book entitled Japan that can be said is not.</seg>
<seg id=765> Nastínili basic features of national strategy that recognized that global influence stems from leadership in science.</seg>
<seg id=766> A key insight had been that military power can zastarat, if "marine food chain of" military technology check the other states.</seg>
<seg id=767> A book is narážkou on Japan's plan "is not" American military influence, when Japan gains control of the key military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768> Knowledge economy can be clearly to build also using oil wealth.</seg>
<seg id=769> For example, like Texas was once as most Southern states economically poor and declining.</seg>
<seg id=770> Although he then oil revenues, the flow of dollars into the economy itself will prosperity as much as they may seem.</seg>
<seg id=771> Thus, like Texas decided to invest money from of oil production in educational foundations.</seg>
<seg id=772> Today, this foundation levels of roughly equal foundation of Harvard University and includes 15 universities.</seg>
<seg id=773> The result is striking: production aircraft nearly disappeared from California, but in Texas is boom.</seg>
<seg id=774> Also research centers telecommunication companies and konsorcií has shifted to Texas, even a kanadském telekomunikačním on -- Nortel.</seg>
<seg id=775> Although industrial production in the US is in crisis, like Texas is one of the most powerful production economies in the world.</seg>
<seg id=776> There is no reason why the same outcome could be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777> First, however, must the Islamic world redefine its proud heritage and needs affirming to him.</seg>
<seg id=778> Iran's debate over Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779> None of the Middle East, it is not about postwar what happens in Iraq monitored than Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780> Geographical proximity, sharply perceived bloody history of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious, and emotional ties to the Shia Iraq and fears from the United States and its political approaches to the region form of that Iran to his Western neighbor vážou.</seg>
<seg id=781> Given the přetrvávajícímu tensions in relationship with America about Iran, above all, the probability of the presence of the US as humny countries and America's dominant role in shaping the future in post-Saddam Iraq --.</seg>
<seg id=782> For outsiders may be difficult to monitor vnitroíránské debate. But this there are and are living, although from a greater international public are not always to be seen.</seg>
<seg id=783> In emerging discussion about the post-Saddam Iraq -- can be recognized three general approaches.</seg>
<seg id=784> Iran's pragmatists argue that Iran cooperation with the US in post-Saddam Iraq -- is inevitable, and to for the rights of Iraqi Shia population.</seg>
<seg id=785> For this reason should Iran to gain the assurance that new leadership Iraq would not to it, hostile, and will seek friendly Translating mutual relationships.</seg>
<seg id=786> Another major considerations pragmatiků include preserving the territorial integrity Iraq and repatriate tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=787> Moderates of this type believe that Iran's government should insist America because of the members of the organization modžáhedíne chalk usazených in Iraq and its of.</seg>
<seg id=788> Iran's government should in turn to offer support bringing peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=789> In short, pragmatikové would íránsko-americká negotiations narrow to focus is on the agenda, which largely reflects Iran's domestic concerns.</seg>
<seg id=790> In summary, a conservative forces in Iran this approach.</seg>
<seg id=791> The vision of another approach is činorodější role and a more active cooperation Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=792> Advocates of this position argue that Iran is because of their well functioning network of personal and institutional ties to Iraq in advantageous position, which may facilitate the reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=793> They say that the US and the international community the value of Iran's cooperation in the ocení.</seg>
<seg id=794> The gratitude for Iranian cooperation should occur in evicting that infrastructure modžáhedíne chalk in Iraq, perhaps in connection with the Iranian by acting on against activities an and to banish its members from Iran.</seg>
<seg id=795> The most important is to Iran from the US demanded assurance that his cooperation is opětována US guarantee that Iran in the future will happen to the American military action.</seg>
<seg id=796> Advocates of cooperation simply call for an open and clear agreement: to bring the aid with maintaining stability in the current a transition period in Iraq and commitment to maintain relations in a spirit of cooperation with the sign any Syrian government, which in Iraq will, for improving the regional and international position Iran.</seg>
<seg id=797> This view is widely extended between Iranian reformers - both in government, and outside - and between internacionálněji naladěnou technocratic, and trade class.</seg>
<seg id=798> Finally for Iran's radicals is the possibility of relations based on cooperation with the US as it is fantasy.</seg>
<seg id=799> They think that America is only třese to undermine the security Iran and to betray their national interests.</seg>
<seg id=800> According to opinion radicals will be the US at least try to dictate a fundamental change in Iran's foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=801> In the worst, says the radicals, America will be actively promote change of the Iranian regime.</seg>
<seg id=802> Will actively to act against Iran learned to use nuclear fuel and gained atomic energy, and may even try to weaken Iran's military capabilities.</seg>
<seg id=803> These radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as presumably the desire of the US obklíčit Iran.</seg>
<seg id=804> In response to this are convinced that Iran must hard to defend their interests, create a strategic alliance with Russia and other regional powers and use Iran's influence in Iraq to in Baghdad zamezilo a's, protiíránské governments.</seg>
<seg id=805> This approach support hardliners from all factions.</seg>
<seg id=806> The overthrow of Saddam's regime was easy part of the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807> Now it is more difficult of: the introduction of peace and security, victory in the war against terrorism and beliefs modest Muslim people that America does occupy Iraq, odčerpat its oil and shape the Middle East to his own image.</seg>
<seg id=808> Meanwhile, the very likely stupňovat resistance against the US vyjádřený the suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=809> Iran is předurčen to was carrying the role of a regional players, because his political dynamic and Muslim identity widely rings of the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810> What happens in Iraq will have profound effects on Iran and the United States cannot be than with doporučit to našly way to understand this fact.</seg>
<seg id=811> America's threats or talk about another war přilévají in Iran's to fuel resentment and frustration and suggest the force of radical forces.</seg>
<seg id=812> If it is in the interest of the US to avoid the consequences of such, it must consider how to limit the influence of their own radicals, and recognize that American interests in Iraq will most more assurance cooperation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id=813> Way out from Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814> In Iraq was finally achieved phase, in which all seemingly want the same thing: the coalition forces from the country.</seg>
<seg id=815> Recent of Japan's outward to inward document British Department of Defense of troop withdrawals this desire only dotvrzuje.</seg>
<seg id=816> The only question is how to satisfy them.</seg>
<seg id=817> If the coalition forces setrvají in Iraq, violence, is likely to eskalovat.</seg>
<seg id=818> But if leave, violence eskalovat also, only faster.</seg>
<seg id=819> The real question is how to reach the stage because, in which will have Iraq police forces and the army, which will be possible to believe that in the country keeps law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820> This is even to notný has long way.</seg>
<seg id=821> Regardless of the many Iraqis who enter the army or police, would it should not come as a surprise that the some do not fully clean motives.</seg>
<seg id=822> In northern Iraq, vyřizují old scores and in traditionally ethnically diverse regions, such as irbíl, is a virtual ethnic segregation.</seg>
<seg id=823> In other areas, to forcibly provides for Islamic law Sharia.</seg>
<seg id=824> So how can Iraq to create a credible uniformované components that will enforce laws effectively, fair and regardless of ethnic loyalties, religion, and gender?</seg>
<seg id=825> The answer is to recruit, train and vštípit "right values."</seg>
<seg id=826> In this, however, is not enough time.</seg>
<seg id=827> For other ways.</seg>
<seg id=828> Given the lack of deep-seated hodnotového system needs Iraq active organization of civil society, which will shout police and military to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=829> These organizations can have many different forms, but it is important to their activities really zapojovaly citizens to local level and to received support okresních, regional and national power structures, whenever expose the abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id=830> If exist control on local level, and support for and recognition of the value of this control at the level of national, then, most of uniformovaných forces likely to be appropriately -- and otherwise, it will be easier to identify and punish.</seg>
<seg id=831> Perhaps it appear to be overly optimistic, but in Afghanistan, the country in many ways the near Iraq -- there are groups that this goal work.</seg>
<seg id=832> Test example of how this can be done, represents a Partnership for Peace and Unity (cpau).</seg>
<seg id=833> In Afghanistan as in Iraq is the highest priority of ordinary people restrictions on violence.</seg>
<seg id=834> Cpau in the past three years operates throughout the country and based there peaceful committees, at the county levels, which have in individual villages support satelitních peacekeeping councils.</seg>
<seg id=835> The initiative is in culture, where the violence is so deeply embedded that there children once taught aritmetiku so that cards dead Soviet troops.</seg>
<seg id=836> Thus, committees to join all the ingredients society -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, policemen, soldiers, judges and entrepreneurs -- and to find ways to address conflicts non-violent means.</seg>
<seg id=837> Although monitoring has nepředstavovalo formal part of the role of these committees (in the future, however, is), the very fact that are in them represented in the police, military and soudcovského the is brings into contact with the rest of the company, provides zpětnou link and building mutual confidence.</seg>
<seg id=838> Some results are noteworthy.</seg>
<seg id=839> One of the workshopů visited of civility local military commander in two hours and the delayed the week.</seg>
<seg id=840> In the conclusion of the omlouval for their violent past and commitment to disarm its dvoutisícihlavé private army.</seg>
<seg id=841> Now regularly navštěvuje úřadovny Committee.</seg>
<seg id=842> In Iraq are projects as humanitarian styčné center in Kirkuk to monitoring function by offering ethnically varied population opportunity to tell their difficulties and use aid in their solutions.</seg>
<seg id=843> Too often, however, is that to happen, even when it is vydáno judicial decisions, as a result of intimidation is not, in turn, vymáháno.</seg>
<seg id=844> Many good jobs at strengthening civil society exact a US and British troops.</seg>
<seg id=845> Neslyšíme about workshopech for the better the status of women or successful organize small local elections across the country.</seg>
<seg id=846> The mobilization of civil society, however, is extremely difficult task, especially when it is to it, as in the case of Iraq needed to quickly and a scale.</seg>
<seg id=847> Military force is still necessary but as necessary even incentive to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities, which are more productive than crime and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id=848> Fortunately, is building a functioning civil society not only important, but also cheap.</seg>
<seg id=849> Humanitarian styčné center in the Kirkuk in annual cost just $75.</seg>
<seg id=850> For 10 million dollars could be the number of these centers zestonásobit -- and even be squeezed into a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id=851> The task is resign ourselves to this approach to extend circle of activity and support to nadoraz beyond the people who, they took commitment to lead the power to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=852> Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis receive security that after many years of suffering so desperately need.</seg>
<seg id=853> Democracy in the Nile Valley?</seg>
<seg id=854> Surprising decision Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's proposed Constitutional change, which would direct and competitive presidential elections, could become a giant step to democracy in Egypt, and in the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id=855> For the people of the West, which is obvious pluralistic democracy, may be hard to understand about how potentially great shift is authorities steeped in a country over fifty years on military rule.</seg>
<seg id=856> Under the current system of Egyptian citizens can to only one in six years in the presidential vote and their say Yes or No to a single person uvedené in the presidential kandidátce.</seg>
<seg id=857> This explains why someone like Mubarak regularly získával more than 90% of the vote, though in low.</seg>
<seg id=858> Syria's and Iraqi samovládcům with this system done even better, and no doubt that vespodu each year, to name and voting lístku having adresa hlasujícího.</seg>
<seg id=859> Many observers have long argue that democratization in the Middle East is far, so long as to fully nezapojí Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=860> Egypt could not on a path of democratization, without first: its constitution -- must be cut faraonské powers president and establish limits on his tenure.</seg>
<seg id=861> After all, Mubarak is president has 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=862> Statements that wants to competitive presidential election is an important the first step.</seg>
<seg id=863> The regime may believe that can process to their advantage, but developments will not be easy, when people feel their power.</seg>
<seg id=864> Democratic genie has been let out of the bottle.</seg>
<seg id=865> In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this neklidném region, which focuses on democracy.</seg>
<seg id=866> Successfully no longer works from one side of the Middle East Turkey and the other Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=867> This time, however, it seems that real initiative comes from the time to and positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and smaller increasingly also in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868> Unprecedented demonstrations against the occupation of Lebanon after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri appears to neopadají.</seg>
<seg id=869> Egypt's opposition groups in the last few weeks uspořádaly increasingly daring marches and other forms of civil disobedience.</seg>
<seg id=870> As a catalyst for their outrage at the end of January, has become the arrest and imprisonment churavého opposition leader of the chief núra.</seg>
<seg id=871> Harsh progress governments revived domestic movement "Kifaya" (enough), which requires the end of Mubarak's regime.</seg>
<seg id=872> Suddenly, it became clear that publicly loses popular view that the Egyptians are passive and are likely to act.</seg>
<seg id=873> On the Nile Valley against the zažité tyranny formed alliance local, regional, and international forces.</seg>
<seg id=874> The current wave of universal pressure, it seems, regime element.</seg>
<seg id=875> Before a month Mubarak the demand for a constitutional reform refused to as "unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id=876> But whatever change his views stems from any succession of electoral initiative is to be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877> It is a necessary -- if insufficient -- step toward the reconstruction of stagnant political system in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878> The Egyptians are now wary of symbolickými reforms à la Tunisia, where longtime President zín al-ábidín Ben Ali created a caricature, constitutional dodatku that seemingly otevíral the door rival presidential elections, but then implemented podvodný race, with a few selected "adversaries."</seg>
<seg id=879> In the past tuniských presidential plebiscitech Ben Ali regularly získával 99% of the vote; now gained 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880> Let us hope that Mubarak think electoral reform more seriously.</seg>
<seg id=881> It is necessary to his candor exhibited injunction to okamžitému the chief núra and to taken steps to an end to 24 years of the state of effectively from holding political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id=882> Mubarak should also accepting limits two consecutive five-year presidencies of.</seg>
<seg id=883> Equally bulk are measures budující confidence, including an open and equitable access to the media that now controlling state.</seg>
<seg id=884> I announced his intention to take the nadcházejícího's presidential vote to began debate on these fundamental reforms.</seg>
<seg id=885> With the enjoyment but I was returned to private life simple citizen, when I this autumn, should zajištěny free and open elections.</seg>
<seg id=886> If these steps properly impose, will the Mubarak's legacy.</seg>
<seg id=887> Together with developments in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine would become the first paprsky Arab the dawn of freedom, has long zpožděného.</seg>
<seg id=888> Historical elections in Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889> Sedmého 11, Egyptians, to the polls to elect a new president. It will of the ten would-be, there are the President husní Mubarak, which this office has already 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=890> Although there is little doubt that the result of elections will be his re-election, many people this process intensively monitors.</seg>
<seg id=891> The elections is 6000 domestic constituencies, and this week, moreover, to the country sjíždějí hundreds of foreign news reporters.</seg>
<seg id=892> But while the process of one with an all formal features of real electoral campaign, some important elements autenticity here remarkably no Provincial Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=893> Despite promises the case for all far from the same rules.</seg>
<seg id=894> Mubarak remains in the hands of excessive advantages: it is known, an effective monopoly on state controlled the electronic media and some 85% of the media print.</seg>
<seg id=895> Week before the vote was some opposition candidates odvysílán in Egypt's television even neither electoral spot.</seg>
<seg id=896> All members of the presidential election Commission President Mubarak and the new electoral rules specifically exclude participation any independent would-be.</seg>
<seg id=897> The Supreme Court in 2000 decided that the results of the election must keep an eye and issue is 8 5,000 Egyptian judges.</seg>
<seg id=898> This was an important step towards spravedlivějším elections, because soudcovská Union, during the last half-century hijacking of the executive power maintain a independence.</seg>
<seg id=899> The Mubarak regime to use the various tricks to soudcovskou Union neutralizoval.</seg>
<seg id=900> One was enlargement definition of "restore judicial" to include even thousands of loyal state workers who have legal education, but zero experience for soudním see. The are the real judges zahnáni into the impasse, because vyjádří-li protest bojkotem their dohlížitelských obligations, would fall this task, and this time police which falls under the notorious for the Interior Minister.</seg>
<seg id=901> And so should soudcovská Union in the past tend to subordinate -- with predictable results.</seg>
<seg id=902> In the parliamentary election in 2000 received Mubarak's ruling party in districts, where the elections dohlíželi real judges, approximately 38% of the vote, but in districts under supervision kvazisoudců this percentage of some záhadou vyskočilo for 86%.</seg>
<seg id=903> This year promises převratnou change.</seg>
<seg id=904> In the spring, the National Assembly and usnesli that if they regime nepřizná full independence and exclusive control over the turn the process will not at the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary) electoral campaign scrutinize.</seg>
<seg id=905> Second, then speak with konečnými demands: to monitor the voting process groups of civil society, end interventions in definition of real justice for purposes of the election and agree to all the ballot box, together constantly přítomen legitimate judge, until přepočítán, remains and nahlášen their message.</seg>
<seg id=906> So far, it will most likely to patovou the situation as chairman of the presidential election commission in Egypt's television publicly stated that rejects any monitoring of the electoral process of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=907> Another consider development on the eve of the election, including the public debate, whether voters in the presidential election to vote, or is bojkotovat.</seg>
<seg id=908> Several opposition parties called its members to elections nezúčastnili on a protest against the svazujícím electoral rules that strongly favorizují Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=909> By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood, which is deemed the largest opposition groups in Egypt, urged adherents to vhodili into box, together with the election and voted in their conscience, but to nepodporovali no "despotic, corrupt ruler."</seg>
<seg id=910> This is an obvious, even if an implicit rejection of Mubarak, a single ruler in the country in the last 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911> Despite repeated government výhradám prepares about 34 groups of civil society thousands of young egypťanů to monitor elections.</seg>
<seg id=912> These groups argue that if regime does not plan to manipulate the elections, domestic and foreign monitoring voting process, should not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id=913> Response regime is a statement that any monitoring externally is action in Egypt's sovereignty and domestic observers urážejí integrity of judges.</seg>
<seg id=914> This argument, however, was soon podkopán, when soudcovská Union announced that the of civil society.</seg>
<seg id=915> Whatever has Mubarak regime fear for the growing pressures from inside and outside to hold a free and fair elections, or is simply incapable of party cheating as a way of life, the current signs of a středečním vote does not bode well.</seg>
<seg id=916> The Egyptians, for the first time, exciting experience sense of resistance against tyranny and vychutnávají the newly nabytý room for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=917> Dollar complex Europe</seg>
<seg id=918> Currency are the only business transactions, but also diplomatic and political půtek.</seg>
<seg id=919> When that happens, the business transactions are more complex and runs is greater uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id=920> The politicization of money during the meziválečné depression was economically devastating.</seg>
<seg id=921> But there are far současnější cases nevraživých currency wars.</seg>
<seg id=922> In the 1960's, the centerpiece of political tahanic has become the international monetary system.</seg>
<seg id=923> Each side should other theory and otherwise, vysvětlovaly the.</seg>
<seg id=924> Europeans - especially the French - complained to what General Charles de Gaulle called, ,nehorázné privilegium "the American dollar.</seg>
<seg id=925> General and its monetary guru Jacques rueff argued that the US are the dollar's status as a major reserve currency of the Bretton Woods regime fixed exchange rates to help deficits hradili their foreign military adventure (this time in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg id=926> France reacted calling for currency reform, which would do away with the strange the role of the dollar, and sought to revive the deeply discredited the gold standard.</seg>
<seg id=927> Europeans began a long debate about the benefits of monetary union, whose achieving them should to face the dollar into faces.</seg>
<seg id=928> From the US, but the international role of the dollar was traps.</seg>
<seg id=929> Other countries could change their exchange rates and the to maintain the greater export competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id=930> The US government was powerless to podhodnocenému yen, which utvrzovalo belief that the rest of the world zneužíval dollar to attack on America's manufacturing base.</seg>
<seg id=931> Nixon's administration concluded that the only way to help the American economy is practice monetary unilateralism - monetary expansion, so dramatic to other countries forced to exchange rate changes.</seg>
<seg id=932> These long zapomenuté battle suddenly appear to be at hand.</seg>
<seg id=933> The world has already does not use a price regime of the fixed exchange rate, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency - a pohyblivý brettonwoodský system.</seg>
<seg id=934> According to the Americans represents a reserve role of the dollar potential threat, while for neameričany is another example of America's Neo-Imperial struggle to hegemony.</seg>
<seg id=935> China's decade of Japan's role in the 1960's, and hold their exchange rate low to export growth.</seg>
<seg id=936> In the US, because stížností nekalou competition and efforts to promote such in the exchange rate, which would Americans odradila from buying Chinese plastic toys,, spotřebičů and clothing.</seg>
<seg id=937> Producers in the US have concluded that podprsenky Chinese production pose a threat to the American way of life.</seg>
<seg id=938> Europeans (especially the French), on the contrary, stěžují large America's deficits and in fashion, once again, de gaullův argument that the world finance American war.</seg>
<seg id=939> Some Europeans are proposing to Asian central banks, the more of their reserves in the euro - a resonance here generálova failed attempt to diminish America by selling dollars into gold.</seg>
<seg id=940> šedesátá years ended crash, ,systému "and massive financial turbulence, doprovázenou rapid inflationary growth commodity prices.</seg>
<seg id=941> To the detriment of lost all and America's role in world affairs was shaken.</seg>
<seg id=942> Such a collapse will now likely to have different consequences.</seg>
<seg id=943> Today's system plovoucích rate is former, and the cost of its intervention are rozložené differently.</seg>
<seg id=944> Most Americans by a collapse of the dollar doing credibility, as foreign buyers are forced to adjust their prices for the US market.</seg>
<seg id=945> Asia's economies forcefully and their central banks are gradually increasing claims in the US.</seg>
<seg id=946> This policy probably persist, for the alternative would be a sudden downturn in the competitiveness of their export sectors in the veledůležitém the American market.</seg>
<seg id=947> This gives us more time to address the trade deficit, which is the long-term unsustainable.</seg>
<seg id=948> Economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia - are a Pact, which through on the central role of the American dollar.</seg>
<seg id=949> Americans will continue to increase its debt, because this asijci for them.</seg>
<seg id=950> The Pact would be to the cause of both zainteresovaných parties.</seg>
<seg id=951> They are not American unilateralism, because it is a cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952> But the Europeans, who are from the excluded in the monetary and economic unilateralism see.</seg>
<seg id=953> The growth of the euro against the dollar is also reviled in patě European exportujícím generators.</seg>
<seg id=954> But Europe cannot do many for its relief.</seg>
<seg id=955> Indeed, in the new currency conflicts Europe will be much to lose.</seg>
<seg id=956> The solution, which was vychvalována in the 1960's, the gold standard or the creation of a common European currency -, are not as too useful.</seg>
<seg id=957> The single currency has proved measures that it does not provide significant protection.</seg>
<seg id=958> The old form of European response - would psychologists might call, ,dolarovým komplexem "- only gains in urgency.</seg>
<seg id=959> There will be challenges to the European Central Bank to spread its monetary base, as would imitation the dollar was the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems sužující Europe.</seg>
<seg id=960> But a short reflection should that, Europe's problems cannot be removed monetary manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=961> Protests against a new form of nehorázného monetary privileges the US should be sensitive to detect gains: it is about the way the compensation real European helplessness.</seg>
<seg id=962> Dollar complex, nevytratí, or even will deepen, because international the value of the dollar money will fall, without it should visible negative effects on those who is out by and use.</seg>
<seg id=963> The epidemic Policy</seg>
<seg id=964> Americans, as well as citizens other countries around the world, they are used to that in the selection of some public officials plays an important role in politics.</seg>
<seg id=965> What is surprising is málokoho (though it is perhaps some zklamán), when the Federal soudcovského office or high diplomatic post dosazen candidate, which will major test of loyalty some principle, which is essential for the or premiérovu party.</seg>
<seg id=966> But science differ, agree with all - and it is here that the United States are vyčnívat as a warning an example for the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967> Appointments scientific positions should be in a objective criteria, education, and success.</seg>
<seg id=968> It is, of course, legitimate the regime's future minister of health and social services to his views about abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969> But it is utterly there is clearly room for doubt, when they are tests political loyalty podrobováni candidates nominovaní in Scientific Advisory Committee.</seg>
<seg id=970> Similarly, that membership in the authorities undertaking peer assessing (peer review) scientific proposals - a process of fundamental importance for scientific advance - would not be no omezováno obstacles to odborným qualifications that neváží.</seg>
<seg id=971> Scientists in the US on such obstacles, narážejí increasingly.</seg>
<seg id=972> The journal Science on this last autumn published a few contributions.</seg>
<seg id=973> One concerned complete exchanges members Consultative Committee national Center for sanitation, elements of centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), without with the director of the center konzultoval.</seg>
<seg id=974> Such cases in the cdc affected also Consultative Committee for the poisoning olovem and its prevention, Consultative Committee for national human resources in research and Consultative Committee for genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id=975> The current the epidemic ideology, during which close advisory committees, and then they are with new members, and when the candidates are subjecting zkouškám loyalty, some observers as usual.</seg>
<seg id=976> Officials of the Ministry of health and social services it called "the standard practice."</seg>
<seg id=977> In America, but this is not a typical practice is not - at least nebývala.</seg>
<seg id=978> Nejznepokojivější news in any case, it is not that the Bush administration is exploring relationship candidates to its "values."</seg>
<seg id=979> Most fearsome is how deep the ideological lustration process runs. Affects the region, which to this kind of manipulation were immune adults.</seg>
<seg id=980> Perhaps nejvýmluvnějším case stem political plague was obměna members research divisions national institute security and protection of health at work, which assessing grants in the study úrazů in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=981> Advisory boards in the past to occasional dosazování spřízněných souls vulnerable were.</seg>
<seg id=982> Eventually, they are policies that then politicians want to, or unwilling to.</seg>
<seg id=983> But research divisions?</seg>
<seg id=984> In October 2002 journal Science an an editorial in David michaelse and groups of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985> Some of them were former every state workers who působívali in several of Chernobyl-affected committees, and bring on this issue valuable perspective based on personal experiences.</seg>
<seg id=986> Their contribution was itself revelations, but what followed, was even the more intriguing.</seg>
<seg id=987> Should bring letters, in which scientists svěřovali with similar experiences.</seg>
<seg id=988> She proposed to koordinačního Committee for research muscle dystrofie National Institutes of Health vyprávěla that was prověřována zaměstnancem White House.</seg>
<seg id=989> First, dotazována on their views about different policies of the Bush administration, from which the nevztahovala to work, and then it asked whether of the President's stance on embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990> Another pisatel, a distinguished a professor of psychiatry psychology, a testimony about him from the White House called on his nomination to national Council for illegal drug use.</seg>
<seg id=991> Volající argued that it is povinen detail, "to determine whether zastáváte some views that could be President difficult."</seg>
<seg id=992> According to the profesorových words followed many issues, with official odpočítával into the White House scores.</seg>
<seg id=993> One example: "So it is two to three; president is against an exchange jehel [in the case of intravenous drug users] of the moral reasons, regardless of the consequences."</seg>
<seg id=994> Conversation, zvrtl in even mrazivější scene.</seg>
<seg id=995> Bureaucracies, dotázal candidate, whether voted for Bush has learned, and when that not, asked: "Why you President support?"</seg>
<seg id=996> This is the nature of dictatorship, rather than democracy.</seg>
<seg id=997> The Scientific Advisory Committee is at a balanced and well coherent Council to shape the policies.</seg>
<seg id=998> If a protěžuje a political outcome, profits is zero - and the loss of the huge.</seg>
<seg id=999> Decisions that research projects cowed, this was never affairs politicians, but kolegiálního assessing.</seg>
<seg id=1000> After all, the law ošetřuje issues, a federal law on the Consultative výborech, explicitly requires that committees, were a balanced and to "were nepatřičně ovlivňovány jmenujícím organ."</seg>
<seg id=1001> US Secretary of health and social services tommy Thompson and personal separation of the White House should go world example.</seg>
<seg id=1002> This can be done easily: by abiding by the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id=1003> The in Moscow</seg>
<seg id=1004> It is time to break with illusory the notion that the "dictatorship of law" Vladimir Putin, if only a single iota reduce lawlessness in postcommunist Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1005> The Anna Politkovskaya, one of the nejstatečnějších and the best novinářek Russia, women, which should have the courage to reveal brutal murder by Russian troops in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin with nothing more than to the tuctovou dictatorship with the usual contempt.</seg>
<seg id=1006> This recognition is for the world, especially for Europe in fitting time.</seg>
<seg id=1007> German foreign policy has been preparing rusko-německých relations that zapouzdří indifference to Putin's illegality, because it is supposedly in the national interest nejsilnějšího member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1008> But indifference changes in ústupnost, podněcuje-li Putin to their illegal methods championed and on the international scene, as evidenced its current efforts to economic stifling Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1009> The murder of Politkovskaya has přízračný sense of déjà vu: in Putin's Russia, as well as for how those days of the KGB, simply losing people.</seg>
<seg id=1010> The journalist is the third politically zabarvenou vraždou for the last three weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1011> Třicátého 11 was in irkutsku zastřelen enver ziganšin, the main inženýr Russian subsidiaries BP.</seg>
<seg id=1012> And 14 11 was had been the assassination of Andrei kozlova, viceguvernéra of the Central Bank of Russia, who fought against financial fraud.</seg>
<seg id=1013> The fact that investigations murder Politkovskaya, as well as in the case of the assassination of kozlova take Russia's general with Yuri čajka, does not inspire hope, the inclusion of so senior jobs in the real democracy vzbuzovalo.</seg>
<seg id=1014> The creation of the Russian government involvement, is almost guarantee that vrazi never be vypátráni.</seg>
<seg id=1015> The murder of Politkovskaya is an extremely grim sign of taking into account the woman, a strong kritičkou Russian President.</seg>
<seg id=1016> In their articles for one of the few other independent moskevských newspapers novaja gazeta, as well as in his books "Putin's Russia: life in declining democracy" and "špinavá war: Russia's reportérka in čečně," psala politkovská about vanishing freedoms, which are hallmark of Putin's presidency.</seg>
<seg id=1017> As exile former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky and imprisonment oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Putin's enemies waiting for three possible fates: vyhnanství, prison or grave.</seg>
<seg id=1018> Neobviňuji Putin's government that the murder of Politkovskaya objednala.</seg>
<seg id=1019> As angažovaná an investigative journalist after beyond Putin by many other people, not least the Chechen Prime Minister ramzana kadyrova, whose obvinila from politics the abduction motivated desire for výkupném.</seg>
<seg id=1020> But even if associates Vladimir Putin is not shot Politkovskaya in výtahu its house in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law in any case, the atmosphere, in which the murder of committed.</seg>
<seg id=1021> As the assassination of arcibiskupa Thomas becketta in canterburské katedrále from many staletími was and the crime had been in clear that King potěší.</seg>
<seg id=1022> Given what politkovská ztělesňovala -- responsibility democratic press question the Kremlin and his policy -- should government to ensure that it a Nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id=1023> In Putin's Russia in the past six years zavražděno already 12 leading journalists.</seg>
<seg id=1024> None of these crimes was not solved, which would, of course, was Putin's "dictatorship of law" something more than PR strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025> The six period from the advent of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin has been strongly, odporujících signs.</seg>
<seg id=1026> On the one hand, see the world of a young and vzdělaného leader, which has vowed to modernize Russia -- especially that conforms his pořádkové forces and the practice of international norms.</seg>
<seg id=1027> On the other hand, President quietly currently, as its former colleagues from the Russian security services FSB (the former KGB) are not delivering later zavražděným people any security and unleashing a series of the notorious Soviet-era spy of against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.</seg>
<seg id=1028> Between these "neošpehy" include journalist Gregory pasko, weapons expert Igor suťjagin Valentin diplomat, mojsejev Danilov Valentin physicist, and others.</seg>
<seg id=1029> It seems that Putin's Kremlin cabal squandered the supposed kultivující influence stemming from the partnership with the West -- for example, in the form of even the G-8 summit in St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id=1030> Confrontation with Western values, and this time just another potěmkinovu village; Russia, fasádu keeps observance of laws and democratic institutions, but these lepenkovými kulisami are still tíž svévolní ruffians unfamiliar with.</seg>
<seg id=1031> The danger in the world is now underway exports of Putin's illegality.</seg>
<seg id=1032> Throughout the "near abroad" Russia is a form of kriminalizované diplomacy.</seg>
<seg id=1033> Just look at Putin's efforts to manipulate the presidential elections in Ukraine and to vznášená and stahovaná criminal charges against the opposition vůdkyni juliji about.</seg>
<seg id=1034> Just look at the unruly odtrženecké regions in Moldova, Central Asia, and in Georgia, there are only a Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1035> And consider how the Kremlin to with its neighbors that threatens their energy supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1036> Every A policeman knows that when criminal behavior remain excluded, criminals are still smělejší.</seg>
<seg id=1037> It is time for the world in vladimiru Putin to see this who they really is: a man who drives Russia back into stínů.</seg>
<seg id=1038> Thus, the world must now to reflect on the old latinským saying qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence means approval -- and to ask the question of whether it is wise quietly to Putin's building illegal energy superpower.</seg>
<seg id=1039> Russia's pipeline to empire</seg>
<seg id=1040> Gerhard Schroeder, who was before necelým month the German Chancellor, kývl that will be the speaker of society that is building pipeline from Russia to the Baltic Sea to Germany and continue to Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1041> In many countries, now Schröder was accused of illegal conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id=1042> The obvious moral failings are compounded by the fact that it is now Russia America threatens to do that off of Ukraine's gas supplies, if Ukraine nepoddá cenovým demands of Kremlin state plynařského behemota Gazprom.</seg>
<seg id=1043> The strategic intention of Russia is obvious: odstřihnout of Ukraine's gas supplies means also odstřihnout most European gas, because some of the European plynovodů lead to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1044> By a new pipeline around the Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries, the promise of the Kremlin more power in order to the regionally.</seg>
<seg id=1045> President Vladimir Putin and his administration složená from klonů former KGB does not have to fail to Western Europe when deciding how squeeze postcommunist neighbors Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1046> Europe should Putin to arm this new imperial weapons?</seg>
<seg id=1047> Even worse, could Russia this weapon turn against the EU that is on energy dependent?</seg>
<seg id=1048> The fact that the company, which could Russia to ensure a means to manipulate the EU economy, will former German Chancellor of dangerous satisfied indifference Europe in the face of Putin's neoimperiálním ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1049> Russia's media are clearly head Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy.</seg>
<seg id=1050> Indeed, libují in it: integrujeme and strengthen our mutual trade with gas, written by the authors of Russian editorialů, Europe will be silent about human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1051> Putin this stance skrytěji expressed in his determination to what he calls "independent policy."</seg>
<seg id=1052> Think the that Russia is to be "independent" on the moral and human rights issues of Western democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1053> Perhaps that are some European leaders really believe that sustain comfortable prosperity union justifies that the human rights and in other issues that the Kremlin popuzují, přinutíme to silence.</seg>
<seg id=1054> To be sure, others may, albeit in short of "trade" issues, such as expropriation Yukos, but once the Kremlin it responds to our values or on Russia's crimes -- for example, in the blood zbroceném Chechnya --, Europeans seem willing to sklapnout rather than by the possibility of higher energy prices, or even blockade, as is facing Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1055> Given how Putin promíchává his entourage, to their will podrobil Duma, the EU should forget about its hopes for an really "European Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1056> Russia that Putin is building, zmutovalo from postsovětských hope for freedom in the oil and gas a bulwark for his new vzornou elite in the former KGB.</seg>
<seg id=1057> Indeed, Matthias warnig, the director general of the konsorcia budujícího pipeline, which will chair Schroeder, is a Putin's friend.</seg>
<seg id=1058> The newspaper The Wall Street Journal this year's report that the warnig, which is leading Russian branch of dresdner banks, have been staff of the armed forces of the East German secret police Stasi, and in the late 1980's met with Putin, when the current Russian President in East Germany nasazen as špion KGB.</seg>
<seg id=1059> The fact that Russians condone the rule of the members of the KGB, for it nemilosrdnost and nesnášenlivost to dissent standard, reflects the their fatigue, from the turmoil the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1060> Now it seems that the Kremlin thinks that what is good for ordinary Russians, is also good for an independent states: when Russia will receive tools to intimidation, izolování and against, the prospect of energy blockade, with small and weak countries nakládáno without compassion.</seg>
<seg id=1061> As a former head of state a independent Lithuania, I was repeatedly forced to such a threat to tolerate.</seg>
<seg id=1062> The EU with Russia signed many agreements, including the "common space" for freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id=1063> The Kremlin very well can such idealismus pretend.</seg>
<seg id=1064> Its dominance in Eastern Europe, always vynucoval on the basis of "the conventions friendship treaty" and Soviet invasion in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "bratrskými" misemi.</seg>
<seg id=1065> Only look as Putin this "common" space abuses: with Chechens, goes barbarsky, entrepreneur Mikhail Khodorkovsky is arrested, foreign NGO's pronásledovány and one of the vůdkyň the Orange Revolution, juliji Tymoshenko, obžalovali Russian military prosecutors from trumped up crimes.</seg>
<seg id=1066> Myslí-li Europeans common space for human rights and freedom seriously, must recognize that vypočítaví Kremlin dosazenci these values not.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The same is true for nahlížení on Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1068> Can really do provide that domovina "Red Terror" with bezpočtem nepotrestaných the crimes of the Soviet era, potřísněná blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus, providing a reliable assistance in order to prevent Iran and North Korea in endangering world?</seg>
<seg id=1069> As likely seems that Cold brains Kremlin only each crisis use as opportunities to strengthen their pernicious power and influence.</seg>
<seg id=1070> Europe's area, which I come, was for decades vydána to evil.</seg>
<seg id=1071> So it so I sit and watch as Europe blindly klopýtá to the new appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072> We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, we of his legacy learned that every diplomatic actions Russia is imperial ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1073> West Europeans, who were the legacy of spared should pay attention to our warnings.</seg>
<seg id=1074> Dependence on Russia -- even though its today's face is supposedly "charismatic" Gerhard Schröder -- will only abyss.</seg>
<seg id=1075> Iraq's the bullets and elections</seg>
<seg id=1076> In 2003, the war in Iraq, the Bush administration very ambitious plans, as in the case of Germany and Japan after 1945, the envisaged for and peaceful occupation, during which ensure prosperity rising oil production and will after parts of the budovány democratic structures.</seg>
<seg id=1077> The should be liberal, even post-modern constitution containing a guarantee of 25% of the seats in the Duma for women.</seg>
<seg id=1078> In today's Iraq is not peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079> The constitution, which will vote on October 15, while zakotvuje the pětadvacetiprocentní rule, but is far from liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1080> The key provisions (Article 2), according to which no law must not be at odds with "nespornými rules of Islam," it violates basic principle of Parliamentary sovereignty and to defend splňovala legislation to international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081> For example, the had zletilosti girls cannot be set on more than nine years, because he Mohamed should devítiletou manželku.</seg>
<seg id=1082> This implies that devítileté girls are zletilé even in terms of criminal law, and can be against them to the death penalty -- say, that they are violated to other religions.</seg>
<seg id=1083> On a wider scale can Shia this provision used to nadřadili their ajatolláhy over the elected parliament, as in Iran, because only those are oprávněni set the "rules" Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1084> Outsiders and a few Iraqi liberals, are worried mainly because of this Islamic provisions, but widespread the Sunni resistance to the Constitution is directed against other článkům: against the exclusion of "saddámistické'ath Party" from the political life and governments and against federalistickým provisions that admit autonomy 18 Iraqi provinciím to integrate them into regional governments.</seg>
<seg id=1085> The rule of exclusion is for elite Sunnis -- including thousands businessmen, experts, and even the artists -- personal matters because, with only a few exceptions, all members of the Baath party.</seg>
<seg id=1086> In theory, can be the constitutional ban interpreted, so that the applies only in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1087> In practice, however, now administrative rules by so that vylučují so-called "senior" Baathists of any form of state jobs, which affects the thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id=1088> Federalistická provision would Sunnis is likely to be accepted by should apply only to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=1089> They know that alternative is not a return to centralismu, but secession three provinces with a Kurdish majority -- dahúk, irbíl and sulajmaníja -- and the creation of an independent Kurdistan with its own financial, army (peš merga) and the production of oil from the vicinity of the Kirkuk, where are the second largest reserves in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1090> For the Shia, Sunnis, the same federal structure reject, because it is as Arab brothers, who in the past always accept Sunni government, and it will do so again -- if will have government.</seg>
<seg id=1091> This would enable them, the new constitution, because the province with the Shiite majority in the south, where much of the Iraqi oil deposits -- could create their own regional government.</seg>
<seg id=1092> So the disappointed Sunni leaders, who are unhappy with a constitution, now in the usual blízkovýchodním style of threatening violence.</seg>
<seg id=1093> Federalist, however, there is no reason why hlasatelé Sunni superiority and Islamists do much murderous attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Their opposition is more: nepřijímají principle of democratic governments majority.</seg>
<seg id=1095> Instead, trying to restore government Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id=1096> According to the Islamists all the Shia as odpadlíci as deserve death.</seg>
<seg id=1097> Also one Shiite leader, muktada al-Sadr, vehemently opposes federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098> His followers are mostly to be illiterate, the poorest and nejnásilnější Shia from in and other slumů, whose "mahdíovské militia" sváděly in 2004 struggle with American troops, though Americans protect Shi'a from Sunni bombers.</seg>
<seg id=1099> A very young priest that his authority sprang from the late father -- Ayatollah and also populists -- is al-Sadr in opposition to the Iraqi living ajatolláhům that abhorrent in his ignorance and violence.</seg>
<seg id=1100> Al-Sadr with them cannot possibly to compete on religious authorities, and so on them ranks arabsko-nacionalistický stance, often reminiscent of the Shiite cleric Ayatollah Sistani, has not Arab, but peršan.</seg>
<seg id=1101> Similarly, to his followers that hakímové, who heads the highest Council for the Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri), and their "badrovské" militia were placenými exulanty in Iran -- and many of them in the long and the bitter Iran-Iraq war on the Iran -- until Americans "nepřivedli back."</seg>
<seg id=1102> Al-Sadr oppose federalism, because the Shi'a regional government would poslouchala its enemies, sistáního and sciri, and his words would fell into Iran's influence.</seg>
<seg id=1103> To its position on stressed sending al-Sadr its men to attack against badrovským militias -- in Baghdad, where many mahdíovců, succeeds, but narazil in nadžáfu, where it is nenáviděn due to spoušti that in the past year has than his man zmasakrovali Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104> To sadrovi as banditovi was something of bad; simple political aritmetika now shows that he is likely to be a key figure in the, which will determine the outcome říjnového vote on the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=1105> To the constitution rejected and necessary, new elections to the ústavodárného Assembly, need its opponents of the two-thirds majority of at least three departments.</seg>
<seg id=1106> The Sunnis appears to be wins only in two provinces, but nařídí-li al-Sadr to his followers in in slums to, together with local Sunni "No," is likely to this will put misku shifted in the Constitution, and ensure that its refusal.</seg>
<seg id=1107> As a political bandita is al-Sadr, of course, to be buy.</seg>
<seg id=1108> Last year, it was vypsána reward for murder.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Now wants the statesman has emerged, money, and at least indirect humiliation sistáního and sciri.</seg>
<seg id=1110> It could get a supply, and it is possible that cutting already began.</seg>
<seg id=1111> Some Shia, on which al-Sadr by words and bullets, however, have tisícovkami ozbrojenců and it appears that the only offering for him, should be the bullets.</seg>
<seg id=1112> The fall of the secret policajta</seg>
<seg id=1113> As has found the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when nahrávka with his an admission of that the government lže, an street turmoil, openness governance in the new Eastern European democracies nezavádí easily.</seg>
<seg id=1114> Also postcommunist Romania, like Hungary struggled to increase transparency and integrity in a society that once belonged to nejuzavřenějším in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1115> Continuing this secrecy, however, despite our fight to explosion of corruption and abuse of according to power.</seg>
<seg id=1116> At the same time, however, finally happened even to real move towards openness -- this progress recognized and the European Union, when the Romania the green light to join in the early in 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1117> In addition to achieve what now EU regards as a "functioning market economy," nastaly and key political and legal change, on which I as Secretary of justice should to scrutinize: from greater transparency and better control financing political parties to far-reaching changes in the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1118> Reform of the judiciary, help Uprooting corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119> Have been have been subjected to criminal charges against the former and current ministers governments, poslancům, judges, national representatives, advokátům, the police and tariff důstojníkům and other public officials, as well as to private firms.</seg>
<seg id=1120> In addition, have been established new a standardized tiskopisy for recognition of ownership conditions and financial interests in all of those who hold official function in government, parliament, public and local administration and in the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1121> The new property confession are nejpodrobnější in Europe, and, more importantly, moreover, released.</seg>
<seg id=1122> The progress of Romania affirms and report accounts in early October, which is now approach citizens Eastern European countries to government information at the same level as in established democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1123> The report transparency and silence, which vypracovala initiative for justice foundations open society (it can be found on www.justiceinitiative.org), even suggests that in certain ways, can the old democracy from new learn: some governmental bodies in Romania are by citizens about the information vnímavější than comparable bodies in France and Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1124> In particular, the affirmative vyřízeno 60% in Romania, while they are conventional and it was 31% in France and Spain 24%.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Among other countries that have a good outcome, and Mexico, Peru is that adopted its laws of freedom information equally in 2002, shortly after the Romania.</seg>
<seg id=1126> To gain access to information in emerging markets, however, it is not always easy, as I during his dřívějšího appears in the role of obhájkyně human rights to the Romanian helsinský Committee.</seg>
<seg id=1127> Often, we had to turning to the Court to on the basis of psyche Bill of freedom information from 2001 necessary published a information.</seg>
<seg id=1128> Even if we, for example, would controversy regarding access to záznamům eavesdropping prokurátorem, the Prosecutor General approved by simply ignored.</seg>
<seg id=1129> So we are, they of civil lawsuit claims and judge vyměřil him pokutu each day of information.</seg>
<seg id=1130> Yet were information -- containing data on the number of eavesdropping approved in the past 10 years, against whom and for how long -- be only after the our case gained the attention of media.</seg>
<seg id=1131> Their by the Romania began oprošťovat from the past, which had Securitate.</seg>
<seg id=1132> Today, and I itself I sit in government, and I realize that share information with the public is sometimes difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1133> But when they are necessary painful reforms, there is no alternative.</seg>
<seg id=1134> Economic and political reforms that US today opravňují for membership in the EU, we were made, if we nevystavili political decisions public control and nesmířili with more public participation in the decision-making process, which such openness inevitably has been accompanied by.</seg>
<seg id=1135> Today, of openness has become part and parcel of the democratic government everywhere.</seg>
<seg id=1136> When in 1966 adopted its own law on the freedom of information, the United States, the Forum for exclusive society comprising then only Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137> Today, such a law about 65 countries.</seg>
<seg id=1138> Those who for law of freedom information fought in Romania, it now fully use.</seg>
<seg id=1139> Autorům studies initiative for justice, who in its within a year after the Romanian government information, were willingly provided even such data, whose published before a few years ago was inconceivable.</seg>
<seg id=1140> The Romanian the Defense Ministry, for example, zveřejnilo number of members of the armed forces who died in 2003, including the causes of their deaths (including the 13 suicides, two of shooting and two deaths in combat in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141> The Court of Bucharest, asked about the data on the number of judges pokáraných since the beginning of the year 2000, including the reasons for these punitive measures.</seg>
<seg id=1142> The Court postoupil vrchní request judicial the Council, which odpověděla in full greater: čtyřstránkovým seznamem all potrestaných judges, including in the three reasons, and annual punishment.</seg>
<seg id=1143> This information is the result of and at the same time, and the ongoing reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1144> For people in government, it is not always enjoyable and sensitive documents from always arise tahanice.</seg>
<seg id=1145> In the former communist bloc are, however, the benefits of transparency undeniable.</seg>
<seg id=1146> At the same time, Romania's experience shows that official secretive remains a threat to the basic values democratic governance and that only constant vigilance in the established and young democracies can prevent its spread.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Zachraňme trees life</seg>
<seg id=1148> No one of US neprožije one day, without would not product coming from the forest.</seg>
<seg id=1149> Paper, píšeme, water, that teče from will, the US had uzdraví, from which we houses and furniture, all this origins in the forest, and much more than most people realize.</seg>
<seg id=1150> Forests by as a fresh air, which dýcháme and home for endangered species.</seg>
<seg id=1151> They provide us vacation opportunities that are in our složitém world an ever-increasing.</seg>
<seg id=1152> About 1.5 billion poor people living in the countryside around the world, depends on forestry bill about their basic needs, such as food and palivové exporting wood.</seg>
<seg id=1153> Yet deforestation continues.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Year after year ztratíme 14,6 million acres forests -- the territory four times more than Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155> Its dead hand over spájí irresponsible forest mismanagement, stupňované bad government regulation and poor law enforcement, and markets, which instead illegal's dřeva, and unisono planýrují valuable and nejohroženější forests world.</seg>
<seg id=1156> When dismantled forests, usually follows a host of environmental, social and economic problems that US somehow affecting all.</seg>
<seg id=1157> A good example is Indonesia's island Sumatra.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Firms producing celulózu and encourage paper bezuzdné and illegal forest destruction, where is the richest diversity plants in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1159> It is likely that, so they disappear into extinction even neobjevené plants and endangered species, such as sumaterský nosorožec, slon and orangutan.</seg>
<seg id=1160> Until Sumatra is their forests, the entire form societies people is without proper for life and without properly, make a living.</seg>
<seg id=1161> Those associated with global markets due to trade with nelegálními, inexpensive získávanými products, leads to znevýhodňování those enterprises that behave like responsible citizens of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1162> Developing countries for illegal extract dřeva comes $15 billion a year to tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id=1163> This was not enough, unsustainable claims Mr on sumaterské forests even anti demand for dřevě on reconstruction year after the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id=1164> Similar threats are clear and in the Amazon and in konžské pánvi.</seg>
<seg id=1165> A recent report Millennium ecosystem assessment (mea) shows that in these and other key areas occurs because of failing mismanagement to decline forests, which will ubývat, if nepodniknou proper measures.</seg>
<seg id=1166> Information reported Brazilian government indicates that, deforestation nenahraditelných amazonských forests, caused by factors such as conversion of forests in agricultural land, intervene in the past year 2.6 million acres, plocha odlesněná amazonie rozrostla on 17%.</seg>
<seg id=1167> The battle against deforestation but even neprohráli.</seg>
<seg id=1168> Diverse organizations, environmentalisté and associations that state of the world's forests about tie its forces to deforestation reverse zlepšili managing forests.</seg>
<seg id=1169> For example, the world fund conservation (wwf) and the World Bank have helped Brazil's government to start initiative, in which the there were more than 17 million acres new protected forest plots, such as national parks.</seg>
<seg id=1170> The alliance wwf and World Bank also motivating their partners to establish Trust Fund, which these protected slopes will be forever.</seg>
<seg id=1171> The summit leaders countries konžské Basin Initiative also result in extraordinary cross-border cooperation in the protection of forests and responsible mismanagement with them.</seg>
<seg id=1172> This led to the initiative subsidized 53 millions of dollars by the State Department of the United States to support the protection of forests around the Congo.</seg>
<seg id=1173> From the first meeting leaders in 1999 has been in konžské pánvi based newly protected a 3.5 million acres.</seg>
<seg id=1174> Nevertheless, given the consequences of Asian tsunami of last December, pádnosti evidence presented mea and statistikám zachycujícím deforestation in key pralesních regions must our efforts to continue.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The World Bank and wwf recently promised that common effort help reduce the extent of the global deforestation about 10% by 2010 and cooperate with other institutions public and private sector to pursue a ambitious goals aimed at the protection of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1176> Wwf studies show that, if they were the world forests divided on a mixture of different use and types of -- including protected territory, responsibly governed commercial forests and renewed amount of forest landscape -- we have to satisfy world demand for forest this and at the same time in the foreseeable future to protect environmental and social values.</seg>
<seg id=1177> Its role in advance this vision must play leaders trade, governments, and the organization of civil society.</seg>
<seg id=1178> They are zealots?</seg>
<seg id=1179> The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led many not only to challenge the al-Saud ruling dynasties prospects for survival, but also to the question of whether the Kingdom is deeply inefficient and destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1180> It seems that the Saudi society gave way of violent fanaticism, on a dream of extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id=1181> The fact that 15 of Nineteen airline hijackers, on September 11, 2001 attacked the United States, the Saudis were vykrystalizovat dávnému view of the Kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182> In some ways, this view is correct, but it is projected to a wide Saudi public.</seg>
<seg id=1183> On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to believe that the Saudi attitude to religion, is in fanatickém islámismu.</seg>
<seg id=1184> The years between 2001 and 2003, I was a member of the team that he extensive survey values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.</seg>
<seg id=1185> Our results are surprisingly softly stínovaný picture Saudi positions.</seg>
<seg id=1186> Compared to respondentům from other countries of the Middle East are Saudis far less religious and their attitudes toward democracy and parents dohodnutým sňatkům also point to the moderate tendencies.</seg>
<seg id=1187> Of course, in all four countries is went widespread - more than 90% of respondents together argue that believe in God, posmrtný life and blue and citizens hell.</seg>
<seg id=1188> But they seem to be less religious than their Muslim Argentines.</seg>
<seg id=1189> For zbožné is short 62% of the Saudis, but 82%, 85% jordánců and 98% egypťanů.</seg>
<seg id=1190> As zbožnější than they are Americans, who, so they call for 81%.</seg>
<seg id=1191> To some extent can be explained by the difference in what different peoples explain what does it mean to be zbožný.</seg>
<seg id=1192> For example, Americans can went to define the other than those in the Middle East, with their definition of will probably cling to religious beliefs less than in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193> This may in part explain and differences between Muslim countries.</seg>
<seg id=1194> But the gap between domestic definition of piety between the Saudis, on the one hand, and Iranians, jordánci and egypťany on the other side is so much that challenging the prevailing perspective on Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and zbožnou society.</seg>
<seg id=1195> After all, actions speak louder than words, compared to 27%, 44% jordánců, 42% egypťanů and 45% of Americans, just 28% of the Saudis said that each week in mosque.</seg>
<seg id=1196> These findings, while contradictory to generally rozšířeným views on the Saudi culture, are less překvapivá than it seems.</seg>
<seg id=1197> The sociologists religion has long claimed that in the rigid náboženském environment, or in an environment where religious institutions closely closely linked the state, universal went public has declined.</seg>
<seg id=1198> Is there are reasons to be convinced that when the authorities vymáhají allegiance to a stringent standards, people tend to the revolt and divert gas from officially schvalovaných religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1199> No surprise, then, that Egyptians and jordánci who live in countries where state faith force is not enforced, are zbožnější than the Iranians and Saudis, it must face local "morality police" zaštítěnou state.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Even in terms of sňatkům express the al-Saud unexpectedly liberal ideas.</seg>
<seg id=1201> Subjects are were on smluvených marriages almost evenly divided, for half held that marriage should be in a approval parents, while 48% of those one as manželského bases of the Union to love.</seg>
<seg id=1202> Given the underlying segregation women and men and otcovské dominance this findings as of strong desire for greater individual options elections in things, which has traditionally had families.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Finally, they will show a strong advocates of democracy, which also belies widespread of the Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg id=1204> Democracy in the form of government's 58% of all of those Saudis, with 23% nesouhlasilo and 18% of their view nevyjádřilo.</seg>
<seg id=1205> A majority support for democracy in the country without the secular and national history seemingly contradicts logic.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In fact, support for democracy is the number of other liberal positions, we are in Saudi Arabia have learned.</seg>
<seg id=1207> Supporters of democracy are less religious, sekulárnější, tolerantnější toward other, more critical to the behavior of public sector, and are more concerned with their cultural invasion of the West.</seg>
<seg id=1208> But the data from survey also history shows that liberal ideas are on the popularity, if people's despotic finance-prince in conjunction with the religious establishment.</seg>
<seg id=1209> In response to the religious despotism Sultan abdülhamida at the end of the nineteenth century, the strong of liberalism in Ottoman Syria.</seg>
<seg id=1210> At the same time, the protiklerikální made in Iran, secular movement for government in the Constitution, in response to the absolutist alliance between kádžárovskými šáhy and religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1211> In the knowledge similarities between these historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should the possibility of reform vylučovat.</seg>
<seg id=1212> The results of now also suggests that they could begin to demand last year policy and less interventionist religion.</seg>
<seg id=1213> The museum</seg>
<seg id=1214> At the end of the nineteenth century Europe považovala Asia mainly as a source of inspiration for their artists, or a goal imperial ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215> Asijci again see Europe a model of modernity, as in Japan during the Meiji, or a barometr decline in China.</seg>
<seg id=1216> One hundred years later Japan's economic miracle made in the eyes of Europeans look at least part of Asia in place to technical and industrial progress.</seg>
<seg id=1217> Today, in the early years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe dramatically changes, because the Asian economies have boom, while the European Union wrap themselves in crisis identity and self-confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1218> Every asijci, such as former Singapore Prime Minister Lee kuan yew, now Europeans warn that if they will continue to direction, Europe has quickly become irrelevant in to all but turismu upscale and real estate.</seg>
<seg id=1219> Prominent Chinese trader that their time cutting off between Hong Kong and London, was even more concrete.</seg>
<seg id=1220> A few weeks on private meeting vrcholných trade and political leaders in Paris said: "You Europeans začínáte to Third World countries trávíte time in nesprávných issues -- the constitution, the welfare state, pension crisis -- and systematically badly odpovídáte on issues that the kladete."</seg>
<seg id=1221> Views Europeans to Asia in general and China, above all, are more complex and kolísají from a sober adapting to the new and respected competitor to purely ideological denial.</seg>
<seg id=1222> In May 1968 in France students -- or at least their part of the -- who have to the streets to vynalezli new world, snili of Maoist China, a country in the brutal and meaningless Cultural Revolution.</seg>
<seg id=1223> Their absurd and výstřední poblouznění was both a unfamiliarity with maových crimes, and the result of znuděnosti youth in a society where was practically non-existent unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Their the inheritors of the today, by contrast, openly criticize Asian capitalist model.</seg>
<seg id=1225> Or China was protikapitalistickou zářnou star utopických revolutionaries; now turned into ultraliberální will not eliminate the scourge of in the eyes of a new generation utopických reakcionářů -- obránců of the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226> Studentští demonstrators in the streets of Paris has recently want to like the Chinese or Indians; they repudiate the logic of globalization and refuse to abandon the hard vydobytých social jistot.</seg>
<seg id=1227> The European economic elites regard China and India very differently.</seg>
<seg id=1228> Now, fully aware that their somewhat nostalgic postcolonial view of these countries such as large export markets and huge zásobníky cheap labor will survive.</seg>
<seg id=1229> China and India have become real competitors, who deserve respect, if not downright surprises.</seg>
<seg id=1230> The quality of the costs and deadline giving in which the production of, say, at the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Europe it maintains advantage in the pure science, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, but the emerging society world standards, especially in India, are increasingly able hire graduates; MIT and Harvard and at the same time maintaining lower labor costs, and thus global competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id=1232> Sadly, while European leaders Asian challenge to acknowledge, it used as a test of reality in nevyhnutelném process of globalization, even as a call into the arms in the social and economic issues.</seg>
<seg id=1233> Indeed, can be fairly say that Europe's politicians, a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, are too pomalí and have their view of the world reconciled with a revolutionary pace of change in Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Jailed between the lack of long-term strategic vision and obsession with short-run interests, Europe's politicians have so far from a nevydobyli respect its Asian counterparts, unlike European companies, which in the Asian eyes are much better.</seg>
<seg id=1235> Of course, asijci on the continent, which largely failed to be buried their history and zabouchnout the door for nationalist strašáky, often the EU as also model reconciliation, peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1236> But if the European performance continue to decline, lasts this?</seg>
<seg id=1237> Perhaps that would then asijci began to the European model regarded as political the type of benátek -- a place that is worth visit with nostalgia for his former grandeur that go with it, and with obdivem to its muzejní nature.</seg>
<seg id=1238> Rudí and modří</seg>
<seg id=1239> Exchange colina Powell for condoleezzu riceovou's foreign minister, the US shows that America's recent presidential elections have remain strong echoed.</seg>
<seg id=1240> To understand what elections call for America, but it is important not only for the Americans, but for the world.</seg>
<seg id=1241> This year's presidential race shows that America's democracy is healthy, but that some things might be better.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Compared to elections in 2000, when President Bush nezískal popular majority and is unlikely to win in the electoral college, this time Bush won a 3.5 million votes.</seg>
<seg id=1243> Although some Democrats are still zatrpklí, serious questioning of the legitimacy of the Bush victory is rarely.</seg>
<seg id=1244> America remains the just divided on the Red states (Republican) and blue states (democratic).</seg>
<seg id=1245> If 100,000 votes in red state Ohio dopadlo otherwise, President would be John Kerry (albeit with the minority who support).</seg>
<seg id=1246> An electoral college was to the US Constitution taken to protect small states in the federal system, but now means that political campaign has largely focused on the battle in some dozen countries, where it is public opinion just divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247> Even more important is that the victory of President without who support is something improper.</seg>
<seg id=1248> So nazrál time for serious debate about change the constitution, which would an electoral college down.</seg>
<seg id=1249> Some observers also complain about štvavou negativistickou rhetoric and advertising, which campaign had.</seg>
<seg id=1250> But it is to be judged in historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1251> In an era of founding founders were newspapers far-right party and George washingtona were terrified hrubost language policy.</seg>
<seg id=1252> For the good of the early history -- a period of civil war and postwar reconstruction, not to mention --, the country was divided and just as now and těsnost punishment is reflected in lítých rétorikách campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1253> But, despite štvavé advertising to on both sides, three celostátně vysílané televised debates it nadnesly important issues, the broad attention viewers.</seg>
<seg id=1254> In general, acting president with growing economy has hopes for re-election.</seg>
<seg id=1255> In this sense, in Bush's re-election surprising, about how poor majority of it.</seg>
<seg id=1256> To a large extent nepopulárnost was caused by the Iraq war.</seg>
<seg id=1257> Kerry tried to impose for the issues campaign war, low level of jobs, lack of health care, and the Bush tax cuts for the groups with higher incomes, but some observers that it never nevyústilo in clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Bush kontroval concerns about security in the face of terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as marriages gay marriage were quashed and the right to abortion.</seg>
<seg id=1259> Eventually, security and cultural populism trumfovaly over economic populism.</seg>
<seg id=1260> Interpretation of the results of the election, ankety in východů of electoral stations, in which were voters surveyed (after vhození voice in the ballot box), what issues are for them, the most important.</seg>
<seg id=1261> Most respondents (22%), saying that "moral values", by contrast, 20% said it was called the economy and 19% of the issue of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1262> Social conservatives this as so that they Bush assure victory and that their agenda should dominate another the electoral term.</seg>
<seg id=1263> Public opinion poll conducted pewovým střediskem a week later, suggested that the "moral values" involves a wide range of issues, not just the right to abortion and svatby gay couple.</seg>
<seg id=1264> In fact, polls show that 25% of public support marriages gay couple and 35% prefer a legal civil lawsuit ties gay marriage were quashed (that is, the obhajovaným Kerry).</seg>
<seg id=1265> But in the case of 37% of those who are sňatkům against homosexuals, particularly in red the center of the country, the helped to mobilize the Bush voters and them go to elections.</seg>
<seg id=1266> More serious question is whether the US hopeless riven by.</seg>
<seg id=1267> The map of red blood and modrých states has on the Internet to anekdotám and kresleným vtipům that blue, odtrhávají from Red center.</seg>
<seg id=1268> Some call "coastopia" (coastal utopia).</seg>
<seg id=1269> Dividing line is not as a harsh.</seg>
<seg id=1270> Each of camps in some countries won only with small by less, and if the map nevybarvíme at the national level, but okresů, much of the country looks quite fialově.</seg>
<seg id=1271> A better description of the than coast versus nitro state is greater cities versus suburbs and countryside.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Opinion polls this confirms, for they show that a majority of Americans do not belong to extremes of political spectrum, but that is natěsnána in his umírněném center.</seg>
<seg id=1273> The political elite, such as the party activists and members of Congress, but more inclined to excesses than the public.</seg>
<seg id=1274> This is initially as a puzzle here, as they should have incentives, could therefore set to the center, which is the rich to voters.</seg>
<seg id=1275> Many members of Congress, but because they represent networks that are for their safe, so their re-election is at stake in the party primaries dominated by aktivistická and radical wing of the parties.</seg>
<seg id=1276> This tendency to strengthen the rise of cable networks, which attract viewers through hašteřivých "infozábavních" programs, and Internet bloggerů, who enter urputných arguments without any redakčního filtru.</seg>
<seg id=1277> Reforms aimed at changes to Congressional districts that would to them imposed more competition, this problem help, but few sitting office holders kongresmanů will vote for change, which could boost the risk that will be beaten.</seg>
<seg id=1278> Těsnost outcome indicates that Bush won weaker mandate, than is apparently convinced.</seg>
<seg id=1279> Given that face nesnadným issues in foreign, fiscal and social policies, retain would be much, if neusmiřoval, with its conservative member base, but he turned to political center. So far, however, remains unclear whether will prevail policy ideological or the pragmatic.</seg>
<seg id=1280> Zbavme, zlozvyku oil</seg>
<seg id=1281> Germany's agenda for the top priority for his presidency of the EU and the G8 startup in January, has set a Chancellor Angela Merkel solution to climate change.</seg>
<seg id=1282> Here is a proposal, that is, a broad enough to world leaders consider and accepted, and reasonably clear to other governments and businesses recognized: simply the next G-8 summit stanovte term, in which they cease to be in industrial countries schvalována vehicles spalující oil products.</seg>
<seg id=1283> Such decisions should strongly positive economic and geopolitical consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1284> The real cause of today's fears about energy is not in the world's oil supplies, but rather that domestic oil production in its largest consumers -- Europe, the United States and China -- an at the very moment when the rising Asian demand namáhá market.</seg>
<seg id=1285> Available resources will increasingly concentrated in the Middle East, simply because supplies in other regions, out before.</seg>
<seg id=1286> The major oil exporters, are not ready to subordinate investment policy demands market.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Saudi Arabia is trying to extracting oil be independent, while Iran potential investors deters byrokratickými impediments and corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288> Iraq suffers from bad security situation and in what Russia now come down to foreign investors's wheel.</seg>
<seg id=1289> These four countries of its own prokázaných half of the world's oil supplies, and two thirds of what would be potentially could export.</seg>
<seg id=1290> These circumstances, rather than the cost of production, is at the core of high oil prices and rvačky about oil contracts in Central Asia, and Africa.</seg>
<seg id=1291> Opinion that high oil prices are good, because they serve on the environment, ignores basic facts international politics.</seg>
<seg id=1292> First, in many poor African and Asian countries are oil imports much larger share of national spending than in industrial countries, which means that it is threatened by economic growth and social development, while there is a new crisis indebtedness.</seg>
<seg id=1293> Rents from of oil production in the export countries from reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1294> Because of their financial power in the Great kondici, regimes, for example, in Venezuela and Iran feels less and less pegged international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295> 's laggards between spotřebitelskými states such as China, mimicking the habits of industrial West, with a long history for ignoring the interference in human rights to ensure lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil obdařenými regimes.</seg>
<seg id=1296> Demand change on a global scale can only the world of political and economic difficult weight, the leading industrial countries that remain far from the largest consumers uhlovodíků.</seg>
<seg id=1297> Change must begin in transport, who is responsible for more than half of the current consumption of oil -- and the share of the likely in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1298> The G-8 countries, why should agree that since by 2025 povolovat will be no new cars driven by oil products.</seg>
<seg id=1299> This decision would not be directed against individual mobility, but against squandered rare source of, whose is more urgent need to production synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id=1300> Political leaders should not zvýhodňovat any particular technology.</seg>
<seg id=1301> Rather, it should automobilovému industry incentives to the development of alternative technologies that rely on pohon from biomasy, etylén, vodík, indeed, during a transition period and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id=1302> Countries that will razit way forward politically, like collateral advantage to ensure their domestic industrial funded leading place in energy technologies, so it bad future markets.</seg>
<seg id=1303> The expected major reduction of CO2 emissions may incite a breakthrough, whose is needed in international climate policies.</seg>
<seg id=1304> But the change would occurred in economic development: if we are vyléčili from its "dependence on oil, it would be more for poorer, less developed and newly industrialized countries and at the same time, it would stlačovalo prices and uvolňovalo geopolitical energy competition.</seg>
<seg id=1305> Geopoliticky would benefits were obvious, as this would be greatly reduce the ability of the major oil exporters with industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=1306> This could increase bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East, and strengthen the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia, which genuinely want from within to promote the political and economic reform.</seg>
<seg id=1307> As technologically advanced countries and a significant producers cars is Germany in advantageous position to such a initiative began.</seg>
<seg id=1308> Merkel, which has't need an of physics, and his political career began as Secretary of the environment -- in 1995 předsedala first conference of the framework of the UN treaty on climate change -- is perhaps to address this issue a more credible than any of its colleagues in the EU, and the G8.</seg>
<seg id=1309> It is time for an adventuresome vůdcovský act.</seg>
<seg id=1310> The myth of trade and aid</seg>
<seg id=1311> Trade and help the international fact slogans.</seg>
<seg id=1312> It seems that increase aid (including debt relief) and ensure better approach products from poor countries to the markets of rich countries are locked in the world's agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313> Debate is now savers about what to do, but how much make and how fast.</seg>
<seg id=1314> In this climate are lost unambiguous lesson of the last five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg id=1315> On the čelném place between them is the fact that development is largely in the hands of the poor countries.</seg>
<seg id=1316> Countries that in the recent past perform well did so with their own efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Aid and access to markets in rarely played a key role.</seg>
<seg id=1318> Consider developing country, which is free and preferential access to market of his biggest neighbor, which is also Coincidentally, the world economy.</seg>
<seg id=1319> Suppose, that these countries can send millions of their citizens, despite the line is enormous beneficiary of domestic investment and is fully embodied in the international's manufacturing chain.</seg>
<seg id=1320> The banking system deklarovaná supports the willingness of the rich neighbor operate as lender of last resort.</seg>
<seg id=1321> Globalization could be better, není-liž true?</seg>
<seg id=1322> And now, consider the country.</seg>
<seg id=1323> The from access to the world market trade embargo, from the West, it does not foreign aid or any other forms of support, is excluded from international organizations, such as the WTO, and cannot borrow from the IMF and World Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1324> And that these external handicaps, imposes this economy also their own high barriers to international trade (in the form of state dirigismu, import tariffs and množstevních restraints).</seg>
<seg id=1325> As has the reader may vytušil, it is a real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326> Mexico has more than 3 500 kilometers long border with the United States, which it provides only privilegovaný market access goods and work, but also claim on the sources of America's Treasury (as it became clear during the peso crisis in 1995).</seg>
<seg id=1327> To maintain Vietnam, America until the 1994 trade embargo, diplomatic relations with the countries navázala only in 1995 and admission policies violated the benefits neudělila many years after vietnamskému imports.</seg>
<seg id=1328> Moreover, Vietnam still stands aside the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1329> And now compare economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1330> From the signing of the Treaty NAFTA in December 1992, Mexico's economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 1%.</seg>
<seg id=1331> This is not only far below Asian economic superhvězd, but it is only a small part of Mexican growth during the previous the debt crisis of 1982 (3,6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332> Vietnam's economy, before the start of the economic reforms in 1998, and when he established a diplomatic engagement with the US in 1995, annual rate of 5.6%, and have since continues in the rapid growth of $4.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1333> The country has experienced a dramatic decline in poverty, while in Mexico fell real wages.</seg>
<seg id=1334> Both countries have a sharp increase in international trade and foreign investment, but the yet offer vastly different picture in ukazateli that matter most: in raising living standards, especially poor people.</seg>
<seg id=1335> These examples show that when it comes to economic the fate of the country, exceeds domestic effort everything else.</seg>
<seg id=1336> Not all opportunities that Mexico offered market of the United States, have failed to balance the consequences of political errors at home, especially the inability to reverse real exchange-rate appreciation peso and expand productivity growth reached in close the export activities in the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337> Most of all, depends on whether a country accepts the right prorůstovou strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Vietnam without any Mexican advantages a strategy that has focused on the diversity of the economy and the expansion of production capacity domestic suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1339> The wider post-War experience support the conclusion that of all, the most important is the domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id=1340> South Korea in the early 1960's neodlepila from DNA when foreign aid was height, but at a time when was on the wane.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Taiwan neobdržel foreign aid and no preferential access to markets.</seg>
<seg id=1342> China and India, the two today's economic superhvězdy, suffered largely due to its jedinečnému reform efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1343> It is tempting to to rare African achievements -- botswanu and Mauritius -- foreign demand for their exports (diamantech or oděvech), but this explanation works only to some extent.</seg>
<seg id=1344> It is obvious that both countries would have been without access to foreign markets considerably poorer.</seg>
<seg id=1345> As in other cases successful development, however, is from other neodlišují external benefits, who enjoy, but the ability of these benefits capitalize on.</seg>
<seg id=1346> In svízelná is, in which bogged down other rich countries on the incidence of natural resources.</seg>
<seg id=1347> In Sierra Leone, the word "diamant" hardly raises the idea of peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1348> And so little export processing zones, which is spreading around the world, had the results of the reported to mauriciu.</seg>
<seg id=1349> None of this nezbavuje rich countries responsibility to help.</seg>
<seg id=1350> Can make the world less pohostinným for corrupt dictators -- for example, wider in exchange financial information and neuznáváním international treaties that these dictators.</seg>
<seg id=1351> As well as an increase in the number of workers from poor countries, which will be allowed to work in rich countries, and providing a framework for růstově oriented strategy uvolněním WTO rules and podmíněnosti from the US should on the development of higher long-term impact.</seg>
<seg id=1352> It is far from clear that enlargement access to markets and increase aid is nejplodnější way of drahocenného political capital in the North.</seg>
<seg id=1353> Development should not focus on trade or to help, but to improve the political environment in poor countries.</seg>
<seg id=1354> Who is dependent now?</seg>
<seg id=1355> If he now alive the late great Argentina's economist Raúl prebisch, they would have divil if the world nepřevrátil upside down.</seg>
<seg id=1356> His extremely influential theory "dependency" claimed that if poor countries too rely on exports of commodities, never will achieve their industrial depth that is required to sustain svižného growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357> Instead, get stuck in koloběhu as global commodities prices and an tenčících income shares.</seg>
<seg id=1358> Prebischova upřednostňovaná policy response protectionism, has proved disastrous US-led for many Latin America, and African countries that have on his advice.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But it is the fact that many years that seemed prebisch rightly pojmenovává long-term trends commodity prices.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The continuing efficiency gains in agriculture and extract natural resources stlačovaly commodities prices, especially in the 1980's and 1990's.</seg>
<seg id=1361> With only a few exceptions, the countries that centered on exports of commodities, managed to poorly, while natural resources neoplývající Asian countries pádily forward.</seg>
<seg id=1362> But today, when the global economy employs Asian obři, India and China, oil prices, gold, grain and virtually all other commodities grow rapidly.</seg>
<seg id=1363> Even though it always will cycles -- oil prices, for example, is likely to fall than they once again rise -- the long-term trend in many commodities certainly will remain for some time, the growing.</seg>
<seg id=1364> One thing, which trade negotiators and other policymakers even to admit prebisch, although it would postřehl immediately, is that this dramatic turn of events poses huge consequences for global balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1365> No other aspect of economic globalization may not be in the coming decades for the world's leaders to provide greater challenge.</seg>
<seg id=1366> Issues are many.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Are today's rich countries ready to the era of mutual dependence, when will after komoditách prahnout as strongly as developing countries after industrial imports and technology?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Are ready to inevitable transfer of power and influence to producers of commodities, it will be a bohatnout?</seg>
<seg id=1369> As the two global superpower, China, and the United States, the deal by the fact that important regions exporting commodities, from Africa across the Middle East and Central Asia are poseté badly utvořenými national states?</seg>
<seg id=1370> Some being soothsayers portrays issue as a problem konečnosti natural resources, and the world are necessary commodities arrive at a worrying.</seg>
<seg id=1371> Many supporters has now theory "hubbertova highs" in oil production, which assumes that we have the upper limits production capacity, scrapped vysychají and by now this will only to go down.</seg>
<seg id=1372> But as the historian points of oil Dan yergin, even prophets of destruction nounced that the world is oil, at least four times.</seg>
<seg id=1373> Each time the threat of zaplašilo radical improved technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1374> At the end of the first decade of the 19th century oil production include gathering matter by mul.</seg>
<seg id=1375> Today, no one is deeply scrapped 3000 meters below sea.</seg>
<seg id=1376> To comparable advances occurred widely in the development of rud in agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1377> No, commodity the world in the near nedojdou.</seg>
<seg id=1378> Instead, but the inclusion of 2.5 billion people (only China and India) into the global economy translates into shift demand, which is likely to storm stronger pressure on the expansion of commodities prices than what can to offset technological advances.</seg>
<seg id=1379> Natural resource prices will thus go up, at least in the next 50% to 75 years, and perhaps to people in the next 500 years will benefit from Mars.</seg>
<seg id=1380> Rozkolísá world politics to change the balance of global economic power, which will result?</seg>
<seg id=1381> The first world war, of course, in part, has Germany's fear that others colonial powers, time reserved too large share of world oil reserves and commodities.</seg>
<seg id=1382> In World War II, Japan similarly strachovalo about the stability of its foreign oil supplies, and other natural resources.</seg>
<seg id=1383> Will the similar tensions between China, whose natural resources are limited (the problem, there is even a lack of water), and the West?</seg>
<seg id=1384> This, meanwhile, are not as likely, particularly given střízlivému and pragmatickému approach China's leadership to problems with natural resources.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The Chinese are rozhlížejí after regions, such as Africa, and hope that it will find a trade partners.</seg>
<seg id=1386> Not political evangelism Americans want to with only commodity exporters, but they want is also turning to their faith.</seg>
<seg id=1387> There are but American leaders who with respect to talk about turning the US in energy supplies soběstačnou country.</seg>
<seg id=1388> But this is virtually joke: excess perhaps, but self-reliance never.</seg>
<seg id=1389> Much of the Arab world understandably, is invasion of Iraq in úhelný the real strategy of the US in the region to ensure stable energy supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1390> If they are right, we can only hope that America has in záloze plan B.</seg>
<seg id=1391> Meanwhile, will continue to rise commodity prices, with oil exporters currently represent the biggest supporters put to zejícímu US trade deficit.</seg>
<seg id=1392> Perhaps the real strategy in the US is dlužit countries vyvážejícím oil money that will feel dependent on responding to America!</seg>
<seg id=1393> This is a reversal of the prebisch that would never nepředpokládal.</seg>
<seg id=1394> Iran's so hard line</seg>
<seg id=1395> The next president, whose, he chose Iran, a man of the hard line and mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, probably will worsen as relations with the West and international isolation.</seg>
<seg id=1396> From domestic, however, is likely to Islamist regime will be well better than, he would have done with more moderate, the result.</seg>
<seg id=1397> It is clear that Ahmadinejad has real base podporovatelů.</seg>
<seg id=1398> But these circumstances that ran as populist, spoke of help the poor condemned inefficiency of the government and served almost as the opposition candidate, are all irrelevant: vyvolencem regime and the received assistance and against rival candidates hard.</seg>
<seg id=1399> The regime shape used their opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=1400> A little pragmatičtějšího hášimího rafsandžáního, which East with some existing policies, into a representative of the "establishment" and their own person in rebela.</seg>
<seg id=1401> Thus, the government took feeling against the establishment to strengthen the personal power.</seg>
<seg id=1402> The fact that last President Mohammed Khatami was přívržencem reform movement -- though přívržencem neprůbojným that nothing established -- underscores just as a carefully rulers political situation turned.</seg>
<seg id=1403> Ahmadinejad is representative of Young activists protišáhovské revolution of.</seg>
<seg id=1404> Directly had been in their holdings of US took in Iran, even though how far it was, remains the conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1405> Nejznepokojivější is that is close to two main groups that are most extreme part of Iran: Islamic revolutionary Republican Guard and organization basidž.</seg>
<seg id=1406> The first is a parallel prorežimní army; the second is the to intimidate adversaries, and all who seek a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407> Fears that Iran conquered even more radical leadership, however, help alleviate two factors.</seg>
<seg id=1408> First, Ahmadinejad focusing more in the internal affairs, because they will try to improve the quality of life of the poorest Iranians -- though it is not clear to what extent to succeed.</seg>
<seg id=1409> Second, the ideological and foreign policy continue to is essentially the same group that is in power since revolution.</seg>
<seg id=1410> President is less power than zastíněn, above all, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah alím chameneím.</seg>
<seg id=1411> Nevertheless, Ahmadinejad's electoral victory inexorably demonstrates the challenge posed by Iran for Western policy and the stability of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1412> In the first place nejkrajnějším a signal elementům in Iran and terrorist clients countries -- Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and to the smaller groups vystupujícím against Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab countries -- that they have the green light to the attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413> All probably conclude that Iran is will promote, whether they do anything.</seg>
<seg id=1414> On the surface, Iran often relatively cautious, but in skrytu is the leading world sponzorem terror.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Individual Iranian leaders sometimes could act for themselves and order and run a operations; now will in such actions of the feel arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id=1416> Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly preaching Iran's spěšný program to obtain nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Most Iran's politicians -- at least those that the government to publicly act -- program, but they prefer to tiššímu and obezřetnějšímu approach.</seg>
<seg id=1418> For example, Rafsanjani, building a better economic relations with the West over progress on nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419> If President Ahmadinejad nuclear Iran, it is more likely that weapons used dobrodružněji.</seg>
<seg id=1420> This does not mean that is shown, but that is used to a diplomatic blackmail and the rise of threats until a crisis levels.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Given that Iran's leaders day all declare their their desire wipe Israel off the map and to fight with the US (Ahmadinejad on the road to voting urně pošlapal picture of America's flag), the risk of confrontation increased.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to be daring in subversion stability in Iraq and his victory will encourage radical Iran's officials, and how extremists within the Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1423> Iran has now ways to Iraq and promotes out of agents, whose goal is to turn the country in a clone.</seg>
<seg id=1424> Iraqis, including the Shia Muslims -- have already practice the same a strain of Islam as the Iranians -- such meddling widely refuse to.</seg>
<seg id=1425> Militantnější Iran's stance may reinforce friction with Iraq and the other anti-American violence.</seg>
<seg id=1426> In short, Iran's electoral outcome is dangerous, while both strongly destabilizing will eventually will depend on the ahmadínedžádově negotiations and on the scale of power, to grant Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1427> To deal with such openly extremist Iran -- radical and according to norms hard regime's line -- will oříškem not only for the US, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428> Europe's states to pretend that into Ahmadinejad militant rhetoric and his provocations do not mind and that Iran's nuclear ambitions can be to find a diplomatic solution?</seg>
<seg id=1429> With rafsandžáním would be easy to be maintenance of either real domluvu, or simulaci cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1430> With ahmadínedžádem vrchovaté rates appeasement, but will be needed to přetrval at least a minimal diplomatic development.</seg>
<seg id=1431> Some Iranian reformers and exulanti represent Ahmadinejad's election in jasnějších barvách and argue that, in the case of his administration is likely to real face of the regime and dismiss the West all the false hope to compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1432> But the choice may also be a success of the regime in kooptování discontent with čtvrtstoletím radical Islamist governments.</seg>
<seg id=1433> Whatever the consequences for the West, Ahmadinejad's victory means that everything concerns Iran, will be even žhavější.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Take and the rich to the poor</seg>
<seg id=1435> President Bush is prepared to turn in coming years, America's budget.</seg>
<seg id=1436> When Bush took office, the prospect of budget surpluses zaplňovaly all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Given the combination of irresponsible tax cuts that promoted the Republicans now dominates the looming fiscal zpomalující economy, praskající bubble stock markets and massive increase in defense spending.</seg>
<seg id=1438> And will be worse, as the Bush administration and the Republicans dominated by Congress are gearing up tuhle fiscal mess even more profound.</seg>
<seg id=1439> Skody, causing, probably will weaken the United States and increase instability of the world economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440> America's Republican Party traditionally supported balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441> That changed with the introduction of the Reagan Administration, when they conservative Republicans favor tax cuts and the cost of fiscal deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442> President Reagan tell the American people that may also dopřávat a tax cut growth army and the their popular programs government spending.</seg>
<seg id=1443> , unsurprisingly, the result has been a series of huge budget deficits that urovnávaly for years.</seg>
<seg id=1444> Both George Bush senior and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes, to the mess of the Reagan era napravili.</seg>
<seg id=1445> Tax hikes probably helped to victory Bill Clinton to Bush seniorem 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446> Yet the Clinton daringly decided to complete the process of reconstruction fiscal stability, in part to pojistil long-term finance pension social security.</seg>
<seg id=1447> When in 2000 Clinton leave office, the budgetary situation was the best for several decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448> Then came President George Bush junior and napodobil Reagan: big tax cuts, major spending increases on arms race and the or even enlargement popular programs government spending.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The outcome was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450> In January 2001 was the cumulative budget outcomes naplánován for a period of 2002 to 2011 with přebytkovou no-brainer 5.6 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1451> In the middle of the 2002, the planned surpluses rozplynuly.</seg>
<seg id=1452> Taking into account the this change economic conditions and the threat of the war in Iraq, one would expect that the Bush administration and Republicans dominated by Congress will in justifying new tax cuts careful. This would be mýlka.</seg>
<seg id=1453> Their highest priority is to approve another tax cuts that most benefit the rich.</seg>
<seg id=1454> At the same time, the government calls for major increase of defense spending.</seg>
<seg id=1455> Given the forthcoming presidential elections naplánovaným in November 2004, we can be certain that or outside the army no and curtailing government spending will not happen.</seg>
<seg id=1456> So, it seems that large budget deficits in the US zabydlují.</seg>
<seg id=1457> If he does not change, the domestic spending in relative to the national income, the cumulative budget outcomes reach for the next ten years of aggregate deficit 1.5 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1458> This can still be optimistic, because it does not appropriately into account the costs of the war in Iraq, another round of tax cuts or the danger of higher interest rates in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1459> How is it possible that these problems are Republicans indifferent?</seg>
<seg id=1460> Some are more interested in tax cuts for the rich than on the deep another.</seg>
<seg id=1461> Others believe that the deficit will chase vast cutbacks on domestic government spending and lessen the state, and it is the desire of their hearts.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The difficulties of this view is that most of the tax on has programs domestic spending rules and will not be willing to support spending cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1463> The question that zaráží more, it is why Americans give voice in the election takovýmto political treat when they should be clear that these problems are simple.</seg>
<seg id=1464> The answer is that many voters impending budgetary problems do not realize.</seg>
<seg id=1465> Better answer is that a majority of Americans, such a policy.....</seg>
<seg id=1466> Turnout was in 2002 only around $40% and the Republicans, only about half of the vote, the voices around 20% of eligible voters.</seg>
<seg id=1467> Of course, the prospects may not be as dark.</seg>
<seg id=1468> The war in Iraq can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=1469> The proposed tax cuts is lessened or refrain from them.</seg>
<seg id=1470> But I předvídám in the years ahead, large budget deficits and growing sense of unrest in both the US and abroad, which will come from America's macroeconomic situation.</seg>
<seg id=1471> Foreign investors may decide to limit the financing of America's budget and current deficit under favourable conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The dollar can weaken and can begin to a greater extent than the fear of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1473> This brings us lose security and flexibility, it needs to be in reactions to economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474> The poor, as in the US, so abroad, could utrpět most, when President Bush and the US Congress and the American people say that because of the large budget deficits is not enough money to fight poverty, disease, and the problems of education.</seg>
<seg id=1475> If ordinary Americans neuvědomí this fiscal danger, the rich may vyváznou with another mnohamilionovým gift to, while the United States and the world ponesou after years of their painful consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1476> The lessons of fiscal lehkomyslnosti America</seg>
<seg id=1477> George W. Bush has in economic policy in the US, more harm than any other President in America's history and twelve and its faculty Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg id=1478> During the only three years in office's fragile political consensus, whose build took a decade and whose to create a can claimed ten years.</seg>
<seg id=1479> But Bush endangering the long-term economic health and social stability.</seg>
<seg id=1480> Because long-term budget issues that the US so bad in, they are not specific, can make fiscal mistakes America to important lesson other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1481> The main problem fiscal policy is that politicians can easily temporarily boost popularity by reducing taxes and increase the public spending and create a massive public debt and its debt odkládají in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1482> This trick can be enforced a few years, but budget deficits and public debt sooner or later be painful turn policy.</seg>
<seg id=1483> Cynical policies, yet can buy reelection, and than come crisis, can no longer be upstream.</seg>
<seg id=1484> One would have thought that after hundreds of such ukázek fiscal irresponsibility around the world in the last decade has will voters on such tricks alergičtí.</seg>
<seg id=1485> But Bush has flaunted yet again, and kupuje the popularity nadělováním gains tax cuts in the current growth military spending, and even spending on education and health care.</seg>
<seg id=1486> The result is a budget deficit adequate more than 5% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=1487> Worse, the long-term budget prospects of the United States were disturbing even before the Bush embarked on its lehkomyslnou policy.</seg>
<seg id=1488> The people of the US stárnou, making the case in manufacturing--by spending on publicly financovanou health and pension systems.</seg>
<seg id=1489> Careful calculations show that future revenues in fiscal policy prosazované Bush is likely to be a desetibiliony dollars lower than spending on public pensions, health care, and other fiscal costs that the public's preferences.</seg>
<seg id=1490> In the future so in a point there will be needed to increase collecting taxes, ostrých cuts in public expenditure, or both were to be napraveno Bush's actions.</seg>
<seg id=1491> So why the public policy supports?</seg>
<seg id=1492> Because the public these long-term consequences little understands or the little concerned, although eventually nepříznivě postihnou a majority of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1493> The richest taxpayers are, of course, are satisfied, because much of the tax cuts will shift is.</seg>
<seg id=1494> It is astonishing that the richest 5% of American taxpayers' was given to almost half of the tax cuts, and these taxpayers clearly expect that the majority of future expenditure cuts and tax increases will falls on the other 95% of the population, the central and lower class.</seg>
<seg id=1495> Bush has managed to convince many voters from poor and middle classes that they should be šťastni without them, but his administration's policies that if he long-term prevails, will have to pay for their small tax cut much rozsáhlejším by government services in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1496> If Americans should political memory, they would, in this fiscal, ,toboganu "in the past 20 years have one svezli.</seg>
<seg id=1497> Also Ronald Reagan, took office with the promise of heavy tax cuts and a large increase in military spending.</seg>
<seg id=1498> In the 1980's was the result of a huge budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id=1499> Tax cuts, he vast popularity and dopomohly him to re-election in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500> Return of the budget back to the surplus, it took more than a decade since the Reagan second term to term George Bush older and Bill Clinton.</seg>
<seg id=1501> Of course, this passage of the new tax cuts, which has readied the George Bush's re-election older and led to polarization policy in the 1990's.</seg>
<seg id=1502> History will almost certainly be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=1503> Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush Administration believes that today's budget deficits have proved to be fierce reduction in government social spending.</seg>
<seg id=1504> Hope that they can kill programs as "Social Security" and Medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505> The American public, however, these programs strongly supports.</seg>
<seg id=1506> Right-wing strategy tax cuts to pozdějšího enforcement cuts in social programs so fails, and eventually will have to be to increase tax rates.</seg>
<seg id=1507> Others Bush administration officials argue that the tax cuts are important for vyvedení the United States of recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508> Also this argument is wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509> The US economy might of recession vybřednout without tax cuts, and perhaps even zdravěji.</seg>
<seg id=1510> In any case, it is a mistake to base long-term fiscal policy in the short the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id=1511> For other countries follow from two vitally important lesson.</seg>
<seg id=1512> The first is the realization that the looming US budget deficits sooner or later limit the power of the United States in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1513> Americans supported the war in Iraq, only that it would pay in the form of higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1514> If will have to choose between foreign dobrodružstvími and higher taxes, with much less likely will promote costly military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515> When the public will face fiscal took, which has left behind Bush, the US is deeply internally splits.</seg>
<seg id=1516> The second lesson is that countries should in planning budgets taking into account the growing fiscal costs caused by aging populations.</seg>
<seg id=1517> Taxpayers or parliaments have rarely on considerations long-term budget conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1518> From governments, why should insist that, together with annual budget proposals proposing long-standing budget projections, which would restrain tendency to short-term political manipulation of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519> The US can other countries to serve as a early warning.</seg>
<seg id=1520> The White House should for others to provide the same warning, what wizards in television adresují told: ,nezkoušejte this at home. "</seg>
<seg id=1521> Securities markets and policy</seg>
<seg id=1522> Many economic and financial analysts complain that securities markets emerging countries are often considerably manipulovány by governments, and that it is the markets more political than economic.</seg>
<seg id=1523> The unspoken understanding seems to be that securities markets advanced countries, by contrast, runs a genuine force economic nature and predicting that their performance is the same as predicting growth trees.</seg>
<seg id=1524> This description of securities markets emerging countries is wrong, only zaujatý, because the same description applies to securities markets in advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=1525> The best analysts know that predicting performance in the stock market any country in nature means predicting as well, according to opinion governments in the political climate investors in the stock market well.</seg>
<seg id=1526> Consider stock market of the United States, by far the most in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527> General perspective, that government between society nevměšuje and that the fruits of investment in the American stock market reflect fundamental forces strong capitalist economy.</seg>
<seg id=1528> This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfoliové investors from around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1529> Returns, which are US securities markets so attractive, reflects the but fragile political balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530> With the passage of time and changes political pressures are proměňovaly, above all, tax rates affecting securities.</seg>
<seg id=1531> For example, during World War II, reduce political support for great wealth and government rapidly increased taxes on capital gains, dividends and high income at all.</seg>
<seg id=1532> When the Second World War provoked mounting a revival of the Great Depression of the 1930's, President Roosevelt and Congress turning point přidali tax on excess profits to shareholders proof that will benefit too much.</seg>
<seg id=1533> By contrast, 1980, when the neválčilo, but the stock market was weak, American voters to for Ronald Reagan, which many thought that is on the president too right-wing.</seg>
<seg id=1534> Asked for cuts in taxes on capital gains, dividends and income, and he was get served and.</seg>
<seg id=1535> Political meddling in the stock market is not only taxes capital gains, dividends and revenue.</seg>
<seg id=1536> Property taxes consumer tax, import tariffs and taxes from turning - that are financing, either directly or indirectly, trade society - can have násobný impact on profits enterprises, and thus in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1537> It is not accidental, that whenever securities markets, the government to provide to these taxes neničily clean profits enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=1538> Policy securities markets does not in taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1539> On the contrary, in profits in the consequences enterprises, and so on the stock market, the effects of almost all of the government actions.</seg>
<seg id=1540> After the collapse of the stock market of 1929, the US government earlier most antitrust, thereby firms to get the monopoly position, which were reinforced by their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541> This policy zpozdila recovery from high unemployment, but this was unable to přibrzdit political forces sešikované under the banner of support in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Similarly, one of the most important, on which přičinil President Reagan was breaking substantial parts of the power of the US trade unions, which compete for their share of koláči corporate profits.</seg>
<seg id=1543> Reaganovo victory over air strike dispečerů in 1981, fault events as for America's labor movements, and for the stock market, which 1982 began their dramatic bull market.</seg>
<seg id=1544> The US government supported the stock market particularly aggressively since the kulminace stem stock price bubble in 2000, most notably repeated cutting interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=1545> To be sure, this is publicly obhajovalo in relation to encouraging economy, not the support of the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1546> But providing a sign of the importance of the US stock market is that it is falling prices stem stocks were deemed one of the most important factor tížících economy.</seg>
<seg id=1547> Indeed, the authorities neomezila on monetary stimulus.</seg>
<seg id=1548> The national income and product the US shows that effective the taxation profit enterprises (percent of profits really odvedených government through taxes) in the first quarter of 2000, when kulminoval stock market economy and generally - mobilize 33,7%, while in the third quarter of 2003, when the market in a downturn, fell to 20,2%.</seg>
<seg id=1549> Much of this decline reflects the direct tax cuts odhlasované Congress and a sense of widespread between businesses that the current economic and political situation can be in tax avoidance more assertive.</seg>
<seg id=1550> After the stock market, rapidly snížena maximum tax on dividends did increase the share of, from 35% to 15%, which brought a major advantage long-term investors and strengthen násobný effect reinvestic dividends after taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1551> In this case, the tax cuts obhajovány with respect to stimulate the economy, which can, of course, to say about libovolném measures targeting support in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1552> Whether a odůvodnění credible, but depends on the balance of political forces.</seg>
<seg id=1553> We can say that in the US are no longer 200 years by the same variable, including resistance to high taxes and weak labor movements - and thus to expect that the will to in the future, and ensure that high returns on the stock market and a massive inflows of foreign investment.</seg>
<seg id=1554> Those who believe that investments in the US stock market to preserve trend strong growth for decades, may have a right.</seg>
<seg id=1555> One would have to be clear in what really predicts.</seg>
<seg id=1556> In principle, by the economy, but also policy, and even cultural values that emerging economic policy, and economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1557> Global Home</seg>
<seg id=1558> Homes are the most local from investment, entrenched in a place as tree, and so are flowering or withered in response to the local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559> On TV screens, we mihotá the whole world, but the market with our is that it is almost exclusively tvořen local amatéry, remains ukotvený directly in the US in its backyard.</seg>
<seg id=1560> It would, however, may soon change.</seg>
<seg id=1561> During the moon Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in cooperation with the my companies macromarkets and fiserv and Standard & Poor 'with a options and futures contracts for home prices in the ten cities of the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1562> The treaty will amount to index of home prices of the S & P / Case-Shiller that evolved from the academic work, which we průkopnicky conducted nearly 20 years ago, I and my colleague Karl case.</seg>
<seg id=1563> For many years propagujeme futures contracts for housing, but no stock market has refused to these indexů to create a termínového market.</seg>
<seg id=1564> The futures markets aimed at prices apartment home to investors around the world indirectly to invest in homes in the US, when through these markets buy the groceries stakes in them.</seg>
<seg id=1565> Investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in home obývaných their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</seg>
<seg id=1566> The fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversification of" or "the distribution of risks" -- suggests that a new contracts will be great.</seg>
<seg id=1567> People and businesses in New York, for example, are too strongly exposed to their local realitním risks, and so should these risks should reduce by selling the futures contracts on prices newyorských home.</seg>
<seg id=1568> People in Tokyo take part of their risks nákupem futures on home prices in New York, if correctly tuned price.</seg>
<seg id=1569> People in New York will increasingly live at home, but investment risk, rozloží around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570> The creation of a genuine termínového of the market with the family houses, no one nepokusil since 1991, when their efforts to cranked up the market in Britain failed the London Stock options futures and liffe (now after the merger to euronext.liffe).</seg>
<seg id=1571> Their attempt never in not creating a greater trade.</seg>
<seg id=1572> Stock market organizing večírek, and no one nepřišel.</seg>
<seg id=1573> The British markets sázkami on the margins in prices apartment home or maloprodejní online markets also never largely failed.</seg>
<seg id=1574> Will this time otherwise?</seg>
<seg id=1575> To be sure, start his own new market is always uncertain: people want to večírek only if there is a lot of people; if there, no one, no one wants to come.</seg>
<seg id=1576> Similarly, in markets where there is little investors, cannot be taken enough deals, which would be left to returns that would investors,.</seg>
<seg id=1577> Just as it is often the case for great večírky, can be a záhadou while as important new markets to move, but we do know that and so.</seg>
<seg id=1578> The first signs of show a growing interest in trade with futures smlouvami on home prices, above all, how the importance of diversifying risks underscore the debate about "real estate bubble."</seg>
<seg id=1579> After the announcement CME one of its konkurentů, Chicago board exchange options, he declared that is a futures and options contracts for the main regions of the US, which have mediánu based on home prices zveřejňovaném National Association property offices.</seg>
<seg id=1580> But with a strong public concern about investments in housing and risks with the United, must be resolved another major thing, if the futures markets work: it is to be here prices and investors must understand what these prices mean.</seg>
<seg id=1581> I think is highly unlikely that many of these futures markets will soon predicting the price declines in some major cities the US during the next year.</seg>
<seg id=1582> In the situation that traders call "backwardation": termínová price is now in the market lower than the price.</seg>
<seg id=1583> This may be just the first day, when will with realitními futures, but is unlikely that the within a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584> To some of these markets can backwardation need to keep their capacity.</seg>
<seg id=1585> Everyone knows that in recent years, many of these cities (as well as other parts of the world) is a huge boom real estate.</seg>
<seg id=1586> International investors will not in all likelihood these cities to invest, if the expectations of falling prices on the futures markets nezohlední how people Tokyo to their own evokes bitter experience well understood.</seg>
<seg id=1587> But if the backwardation sufficient, even investors, who think that the US market is is bound to decline, power since futures on home prices to expect a decent profit, because get reduced prices are already on the termínovém market.</seg>
<seg id=1588> But this will require that people in New York to ensure their investments in real estate adapt the fact that will sell futures contracts, zapracovaným cenovým plummeting.</seg>
<seg id=1589> They will be have to get on the idea that the market for weakening expected, and that can protect just before the extent of the possible future of falling prices, which is over this.</seg>
<seg id=1590> To korekcím our thinking is likely to occur, indeed, we will see a future market prices.</seg>
<seg id=1591> So far, the future direction of real estate prices only a matter of various views.</seg>
<seg id=1592> When markets would create international consensus about the future of home prices in cities around the world, we can better to manage the risks that this cities face, and the stabilize the economy -- and our lives.</seg>
<seg id=1593> That news moving markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594> Stock markets in most of the world, roughly from on May a growing downturns; the main of dvoutýdenního occurred during the period of roughly into on May, but prices continue to an average of fall.</seg>
<seg id=1595> Mean problems in the world's stock markets, the problem for the world economy?</seg>
<seg id=1596> Consider the strongest declines.</seg>
<seg id=1597> From indexů few countries to the biggest collapse in India, where on may into "may falling stock prices a 16.9%.</seg>
<seg id=1598> A disaster on the other side of the planet was almost as large and the upper and the lower highs from level in India ones one day or two: in Argentina stock prices have risen 16,1% in Brazil about 14,7% and in Mexico about 13,8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599> European markets also suffered major losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600> In Sweden from May 9th into "may stock prices falling about 15,2%; in almost totožného period fall prices of 9.7% in Germany, 9,4% in France and Britain and the 9,3% in Italy.</seg>
<seg id=1601> Similarly, stock prices in Asia during the period of equal standing; almost sank from the highest in the lowest in the value of the 11,5% in Korea, 9,3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan.</seg>
<seg id=1602> Many commentators tries to link these events with developments in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1603> But US stocks prices fell until May 9th between and 24. until may only by 5.2%.</seg>
<seg id=1604> For global decline in seems to be nor China, because their stock market prices in fact during this period increased.</seg>
<seg id=1605> The usual explanations economists revolve around monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1606> In the wake of the deflationary bázně 2003 central banks around the world would cut interest rates, inciting speculative boom on the stock market, and in the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id=1607> But now, according to this view, hlodat are rising interest rates, which does other downturns asset prices.</seg>
<seg id=1608> This argument, of course, the point.</seg>
<seg id=1609> America's Federal Reserve really on may raising rates and his Chairman Ben Bernanke then suggested that can be another increases in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1610> On May 17th were published data on deterioration of US inflation, signalizující that there is another monetary tightening.</seg>
<seg id=1611> Economists like to the world as a logical and zvladatelný, which implies that've gotten the message of what is happening.</seg>
<seg id=1612> This his approach, however, often exaggerate the role of central banks.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Indeed, America's rate hike was only one in a number of -- have šestnáctým.</seg>
<seg id=1614> From the moment in may declines in stock markets began, no other major central bank rates has not increased, and to the 7-8. June when did several banks (the European Central Bank, and banks in India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey).</seg>
<seg id=1615> Another factor is the price of oil from "March to 2 may rose by 24% and, in that time absolute rekordy.</seg>
<seg id=1616> Clearly, this was an important event, which should credibly influence stock markets around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1617> Increases in oil prices were culprit virtually all economic recession since World War II.</seg>
<seg id=1618> Yet rises oil prices in the neodpovídají interval, when in half may index of stock markets sank most.</seg>
<seg id=1619> To argue that, higher oil prices incited stock downturns, we assume několikatýdenní time prodlevu.</seg>
<seg id=1620> Stock markets, however, are not too logical and overdue response to shocks oil prices could happen.</seg>
<seg id=1621> Like all other prices in financial markets, increased incites attention.</seg>
<seg id=1622> When oil prices rise sharply, people do not news about oil prices and about these prices and talk, triggering greater vulnerability to these reports.</seg>
<seg id=1623> To oil prices has crisis in the Middle East and the in may in coverage dominated.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Increases in oil prices in thinking investors, perhaps even umocnily ominous indications and strong words some political personalities.</seg>
<seg id=1625> Israel's deputy prime minister Shimon Peres 8 May in response to the hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that "the president of Iran should remember that Iran may also be wiped off the map."</seg>
<seg id=1626> In the early květnového stock collapse, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the largest state with Muslim majority, and on 13 may psaly newspapers that it on two leading universities in the country received from students ovací vestoje.</seg>
<seg id=1627> This report might be regarded as the illustration that the Ahmadinejad politically pays his game with fire in the nuclear issue, which would were reinforced by the impression that would napjatá situation in the Middle East could result in even higher oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1628> This may seem far more than akciovému market monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629> But the response to them, together with the recent zvýšeními oil prices, can largely explain change market psychology.</seg>
<seg id=1630> Approaches to risk, with the passage of time changing and events as ahmadínedžádovy and peresovy remarks can such changes precipitate.</seg>
<seg id=1631> So, although these issues are framed in ways that it is hard to kvantifikovat, analysts would probably in order to understand the direction of the world's stock markets should pay attention to ahmadínedžádovým words as carefully as yet bernankeovým.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Economists may be was as enthusiastic about that should focus on public opinion on how the price changes, on the world coverage and on the speculative dynamism.</seg>
<seg id=1633> After all, such an approach that economic events are less predictable (and economists less vševědoucí) than represent.</seg>
<seg id=1634> Such a focus but gives intuitively sense.</seg>
<seg id=1635> What really have ideas investors?</seg>
<seg id=1636> Ahmadinejad is charismatická person; Bernanke is not.</seg>
<seg id=1637> Ahmadinejad in riskantního enterprise; Bernanke is not.</seg>
<seg id=1638> And what is perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad has destabilizing influence; Bernanke is not.</seg>
<seg id=1639> Indeed, whatever the primary cause global downturns stock prices of half may any, for an unstable market psychology are significant.</seg>
<seg id=1640> It can be to believe that the related to the views on the probable monetary policy and not to the bigger and deeper issues, including the energetickému and political tensions, which on performance of the world economy.</seg>
<seg id=1641> Why, pay for férovost?</seg>
<seg id=1642> 's marks & Spencer, a chain of supermarkets and a clothing, 400 shops across Britain, recently announced that the their sortiment coffee and tea fairly 38 species, přechází to fairtrade, marketingovému symbolu "ethical output."</seg>
<seg id=1643> In their 200 cafes café revive the chain of command sells only čaj and coffee, brand names fairtrade.</seg>
<seg id=1644> They are also hýbat its sales of košilí and other goods from fairtrade cotton.</seg>
<seg id=1645> Announcement came during the campaign "fairtrade fortnight," dvoutýdenní promotion of products férového trade, whose part of it besední trail farmers from developing countries, as the British vylíčili fairtrade helps their community.</seg>
<seg id=1646> The shift to ethical consumption is a major increase in the United States, as consumers, increasingly reverting to with an, lokálně vyráběným potravinám and to vejcím from slepic that are not being held in klecích.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In Britain, průzkumem discovered that half of those who was put to a symbol of fairtrade, this brand of suffered and knew that calls products, which provide a decent conditions for farmers Third World.</seg>
<seg id=1648> A similar poll in the US there is, but related data and discussions with my own as students suggest that number would be much lower.</seg>
<seg id=1649> Traders to certifikaci fairtrade must manufacturers pay $that pokryje costs sustainable production and ensure wage to live on.</seg>
<seg id=1650> For example, the minimum the price of coffee $1,26 is for the pound, no matter how far can fall market price.</seg>
<seg id=1651> If the market price vystoupá over the amount fairtrade price rise to kept the five per pound.</seg>
<seg id=1652> From small farmers are to organizovali to družstev or other groups that enable democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653> Plantáže and manufacturing businesses can identify fairtrade use, if their workers in providing a decent salaries rate hygienické, security, and environmental standards, allow yet unions and other forms of association, exactly, a good housing, if they did not live at home, and do not have forced child labor.</seg>
<seg id=1654> Not every fairtrade approval.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Brink lindsey, director of protržního centers for research trade policies in katonově Institute, believe that káva fairtrade is "well míněná blind alley."</seg>
<seg id=1656> To some extent rightly claim that the real cause of the fall in prices coffee was ziskuchtivost multinational corporations, but the big increases in the production of coffee in Brazil and in Vietnam, together with the new practices that enable coffee to the use of less labor force, and thus less costly.</seg>
<seg id=1657> According to the lindseyova view, if we are to pěstitelům coffee aid, we should is to persuade to switch from coffee to výnosnějším plodinám -- and here for the obstacles to remove the, rightly calls trade barriers and subsidies of the rich countries -- or to turned to products with higher value, for example, to speciálním coffee, which brings higher prices.</seg>
<seg id=1658> But what is the lindseyově special argument is that the campaign for fairtrade coffee can be seen as for the what he advocates -- persuasion farmers to vyráběli special kind of coffee, which provide them with higher prices.</seg>
<seg id=1659> The pro-market economists nothing nenamítají when corporations to the promotion of their products blatantly use snobskou appeal.</seg>
<seg id=1660> If people pay 48 dollars per pound coffee from jamajských modrých mountains, because it has to James know how Bond, economists, nenamítají that this pokřivuje market.</seg>
<seg id=1661> So why be critical, when consumers they pay $12 pound coffee, which they know that was vypěstována without the toxic chemicals, under stinnými trees, which helped to survive ptactvu, and farmers, who now can afford to feed their children and send them into schools?</seg>
<seg id=1662> Economists can answer that if you want to help with výživou and education their children, you for ten dollars, buy coffee loga without fairtrade that chutná as, and take two dollars to developing service, which provides food and education for poor children.</seg>
<seg id=1663> While this is possible, but fairtrade has its benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1664> Pěstitelé know that they must provide a product, who have consumers they, both for his taste, and for the way to a.</seg>
<seg id=1665> If their product well sells, can be proud of that vyrobili something about what is around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1666> From the perspective of the pěstitele is better get compensation for the sales products fairtrade than philanthropic příděl that would receive an even without work and regardless of the quality of what they produce.</seg>
<seg id=1667> Připlatit for brand of fairtrade is no more "protitržní" than pay more for brand of Gucci and this reflects a better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1668> Division trade is state subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=1669> His success depends on the political lobbingu, but on market demand.</seg>
<seg id=1670> In Europe, the market demand is soaring.</seg>
<seg id=1671> One hopes that similar levels of soon achieve in the developed world and where people can decide their freely zvažovaných spending.</seg>
<seg id=1672> Pigs, telata and America's Democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673> In the midst of an explosion of titulků that control of the Congress of the United States, in listopadových elections Democrats, was largely ignored one great electoral outcome.</seg>
<seg id=1674> It on the one hand, obnažil weaknesses of America's political system, but also to my belief in soucitnost Ordinary Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1675> If citizens arizony accumulated sufficient number of podpisů may lose a draft law to vote in direct popular vote.</seg>
<seg id=1676> One of the referenda licensing zakazoval bill that would uvazování or closing the pregnant prasnic or telat farm-raised into meat in such a way that animals from the freely otočit, lehnout, and a, natáhnout končetiny.</seg>
<seg id=1677> People who about the modern industrial agriculture many people, can ask ourselves, why is no such legislation needed.</seg>
<seg id=1678> Agricultural methods that even 50 years ago, generally followed and in some countries are common still, after all, are all animals enough space on the otočení and stretching their končetin.</seg>
<seg id=1679> In the US, about 90% of the prasnic -- mothers pigs farm-raised and zabíjených on porcine meat, some bacon inside and šunku -- spend most life uzamčeno in klecích the size of about .6 krát 2.2 meters.</seg>
<seg id=1680> Can they otočit, lehnout with nataženýma feet or do more than one step forward or bus.</seg>
<seg id=1681> Another prasnice are chovány in the short provazech, they also from otáčení.</seg>
<seg id=1682> Also telata are the life it in individual kójích that they make the otočit, lehnout, or natáhnout končetiny.</seg>
<seg id=1683> The purpose of these methods is saving jobs -- facilitate the manipulation of the more difficult to remain thousands of or tens of thousands of animals in lower staff and lower nárocích on their expertise.</seg>
<seg id=1684> In addition, from animals mrhat energy in motion or of mutual potyčkách.</seg>
<seg id=1685> After the protests to animals, the European Commission of a few years ago objednala in their scientific veterinární Commission report on these methods.</seg>
<seg id=1686> The Commission review that animals the obstacle passing move freely and total lack of any náplně during the day.</seg>
<seg id=1687> Of course, this conclusion would have to be and common sense.</seg>
<seg id=1688> The EU after report has set data, whose mark will stěsnané conditions for these animals banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689> Date set by for telata, 1 January 2007, is almost here.</seg>
<seg id=1690> The kóje for prasnice that are already in the UK and Sweden illegal, by 2013 banned in the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Gradually are adopted also improve conditions laying hens, which typically mačkají in holých wire klecích, where they are not enough to roztáhly wings.</seg>
<seg id=1692> In the US are similar measures at the national level in sight.</seg>
<seg id=1693> When I my European friends in the past ptali, why the United States on living conditions animals and strongly lag behind for Europe, I on this no answer.</seg>
<seg id=1694> After another insistence, I had to acknowledge and explanation that Americans animal matter less than Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695> , and then in 2002 to guards animals in Florida to všelidovému voting proposal, which would prasnic farming banned in kójích.</seg>
<seg id=1696> To the surprise of many for this proposal vyslovilo 55% of the votes.</seg>
<seg id=1697> In the listopadovém referendum in arizoně hlasovalo despite well-paid opposition from the agrobyznysu 62% of the electorate to ban small klecí for prasnice and telata.</seg>
<seg id=1698> Florida or arizona are not progressive states -- both in 2004 favor George W. Bush before John Kerry.</seg>
<seg id=1699> So the results strongly suggests that if they received an opportunity to vote on a side of the prasnic and telat in a tiny cramped conditions all Americans, most would have a against.</seg>
<seg id=1700> It seems that Americans depends on welfare animals as Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1701> So, if we are to explain the gap between Europe and the US on the conditions for agricultural animals, we should focus on the political system.</seg>
<seg id=1702> In Europe voters concern about the well-being of animals effectively affecting deputies national parliaments, but also members of the European Parliament, the result that were national laws and the EU directive that this concern react.</seg>
<seg id=1703> By contrast, in the US should such a concern for members of Congress no obvious effect.</seg>
<seg id=1704> Conditions bring farm animals neupravuje no federal legislation -- and very few legislation state.</seg>
<seg id=1705> According to me, this is that agrobyznys can nastrkat for dollars into the pockets of to Congressional Congress seeking re-election.</seg>
<seg id=1706> Movement for animal rights, despite the broad public support has fails to in political arena lobbismu and subsidies to electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1707> In America's electoral politics have money worth more than the views of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1708> Party discipline is weak and the Congressmen must most money needed to re-election choose themselves -- and, in the case of the members of the House of Representatives going every two years.</seg>
<seg id=1709> In Europe, with a strong party discipline and electoral campaign nefinancují individual candidates, but parties are money smaller role.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In the US, a country that display their democratic traditions are pigs and telata hardly unique, who loses.</seg>
<seg id=1711> What is happening in the new the Afghan army?</seg>
<seg id=1712> The assassination of Afghanistan's Secretary of the air transport rozzuřeným the (fueled perhaps members of the Afghan interim administration) shows that the Afghan society remains deeply ambivalent.</seg>
<seg id=1713> The first reforms of the Afghan army this ambivalence even increase.</seg>
<seg id=1714> Secretary of Defense temporary Hamid Karzai's government has appointed a vrchní officers of the new army.</seg>
<seg id=1715> Foreign Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, tádžik of Northern panjsirského district in the three months ago command of the forces that dobyly Kabul by the Northern Alliance, for the help of American bombers.</seg>
<seg id=1716> But this appointment Karzai's efforts to unite the country overall impugned.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Afghanistan is a state, in which nejpočetnějsí pastuni are two out of of the total population.</seg>
<seg id=1718> Hazárové and excluded form the other two out of.</seg>
<seg id=1719> From 30 eight officers that povýsil to hodnosti Fahim Secretary General is Thirty seven tádžiků and one of the is Uzbek.</seg>
<seg id=1720> If the army summoned any from 15 to seventeen million pastunů will be put on the under the sestávajícím almost entirely of tádžiků.</seg>
<seg id=1721> Pastunstina, from tádžičtiny different as well as spanělstina from the English and millions of pastunů have přinejlepsím only basic knowledge of tádžičtiny.</seg>
<seg id=1722> Geografický profile new military leadership is as the narrow as his ethnic composition.</seg>
<seg id=1723> Thirty five from 30 eight senior officers comes from the smaller the North from Kabul, from the province parwan (which is bagramské letistě) and from nedalekého panjsirského Valley, which was for a long time the root of the Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=1724> In other words, from the new military elite countries was vynecháno twenty seven of the twenty nine Afghan provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1725> Such closely orientovaná group might prevent rather closed clique, if it is composed of representatives at least 12 political parties.</seg>
<seg id=1726> But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Eighteen from 30 eight generals are members of the only party, jamiat-e-islami, Islamic factions that for a long time led and former professor theology Mullah Burhanuddin rabbání.</seg>
<seg id=1728> This party ruled in short in Kabul in the 1990's, causing bloodshed and chaos, as most Afghans welcomed the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id=1729> Virtually in the same number of as jamiat Party members are in military command represented the Communists.</seg>
<seg id=1730> Sestnáct from 30 eight generals, after a long time řadilo to side, whose activities in the late 1970's led to the Soviet invasion in the years 1979-89, which resulted in the life of two and a half million Afghans.</seg>
<seg id=1731> Most Afghans now on the Communists nahlíží as these supportive as they are, for example, česi or Poles to hitlerovým national poised.</seg>
<seg id=1732> It is true that Afghans, as well as other, had to join the Communist Party nejrůznějsí reasons, and in no case cannot be said that each was founded ideologem.</seg>
<seg id=1733> But between fahimovými generals is six former party professionals who side served even after ending the invasion of the Red Army.</seg>
<seg id=1734> All six of these men, and three other the Communists, who served as officers of the Afghan army, actively cooperating in of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1735> We can to see how would probably, for example, the French, if a quarter of the French důstojnického of the after World War II, individuals cooperative in its occupation of their countries with wehrmachtem.</seg>
<seg id=1736> After Afghanistan, innovations expand fast mouth.</seg>
<seg id=1737> If so, it did not, possible unless Afghanistan's young males nationalists (which virtually all Afghans are) soon political awareness of the circle around the general fahima expose.</seg>
<seg id=1738> But this also embarrassing evidence and bias question the military high command might be partially vyvrácen if new generals přináseli into national armed forces real professionalism and commitment to vlasteneckým values.</seg>
<seg id=1739> Unfortunately, only ten from 30 eight povýsených leaders has experience as professional military officers.</seg>
<seg id=1740> Jedenáctý serve as a pilot.</seg>
<seg id=1741> By contrast, two four of total (professional experience the other four generals are not known) comes from the civilian life in which worked in different profesích, for example, as officials of the Communist Party, one of them, then a career Mullah.</seg>
<seg id=1742> What do these data for daily practice mean?</seg>
<seg id=1743> Mean that commanders international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, as well as the American military and diplomatic officials, will meet with provide Afghan Deputy Secretary of Defense abdulem rásídem dostumem, a notorious its and corrupt commander, communist that keeps contacts with the old friends from the Red Army continues to serving in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1744> This means that the Afghan armed forces, as well as a strategic commander and the military intelligence services are also the Communists, people, their orientation is uncertain, individuals that most Afghans trust.</seg>
<seg id=1745> Is this really group that war is divided Afghanistan together again together?</seg>
<seg id=1746> Will these dubious to generals to gain confidence three čtvrtin Afghan population, which was to vrchnímu armádnímu command zamezen approach?</seg>
<seg id=1747> Or is it more outcome bezuzdného approach to government, which (sometimes in the future) will another bloody ethnic response those whose there are reasons interests were now cynically poslapány?</seg>
<seg id=1748> The United Nations, however, and American political leaders should these questions consider sooner than with bezohledným recognition of power small and unpopular mensinou smíří.</seg>
<seg id=1749> The celebration of a iracionálna</seg>
<seg id=1750> Three cheers for new Nobel Prize winners in economics, danielu kahnemanovi at Princeton University and vernonu smithovi of the university George masona in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751> As the Nobel prizes are, this unappreciated recognition are not only the original work kahnemana and Smith, but also belief schools, whose main representative both scientists.</seg>
<seg id=1752> The psychologist Kahneman showed that individuals systematically feel less reasonably than they orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg id=1753> His research not only demonstrates that people often act otherwise than predict the standard economic theory, but also that do so regularly, systematically and in ways that one can understand and interpret through alternative hypotéz, which compete with the assumptions with whom they operate orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg id=1754> Most countries in the market - but ordinary monitors, this will not like nothing převratného.</seg>
<seg id=1755> Makléři on Wall Street, who sell shares, which they knew that nothing is not the idea that Kahneman and Smith were routinely consuming and zneužívali.</seg>
<seg id=1756> Mania, that "bublinovou" economy was largely based on the use of investorské psychology.</seg>
<seg id=1757> This iracionalita is nothing new, nor for economists.</seg>
<seg id=1758> John Maynard Keynes, no longer about securities markets, he wrote that they are based on racionálních individuals rather snažících about the discovery of the fundamental principles markets, but that it is more about competition beauty, in which wins the who can best guess what he porota.</seg>
<seg id=1759> This year's Nobel Prize is like loňská (which I was one of the three laureátů) also criticism simplistic market economy.</seg>
<seg id=1760> Loňští laureáti putting emphasis on that different market participants have different (and imperfect) information, and that these asymmetries of information has profound impact on the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761> Loňští Nobel laureates suggested that markets are not effective widely and that have an important role sehrávat governments.</seg>
<seg id=1762> Adam Smith's invisible hand, the idea that free markets led to efficiency as an invisible hands - is invisible at least partly because there is nothing.</seg>
<seg id=1763> For those who each day work on the markets (and earn of money by using and obcházejí information asymetrii) is not that no innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1764> For more than twenty years, the economists are preoccupied with the patterns of "racionálních expectations," which assume that all market participants have the same (if not perfect information) and act perfectly reasonably that markets are perfectly effective that there is no unemployment (except in cases, when it will cause chtivé unions or government minimum wages) or credit přídělové systems.</seg>
<seg id=1765> That such models převládaly, especially in the American universities, despite the evidence of their zkreslenosti about the triumph of ideology of science.</seg>
<seg id=1766> Many graduates these universities, however, are now in charge of politics and economics in many countries of the world and build programs, based on the passage of time to be market fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id=1767> The right to put it: models rational expectations are major contribution to the economic science; the vibrancy of with which their advocates of undertook in economic thinking, contributed to the discovery of the weaknesses of the hypotéz count.</seg>
<seg id=1768> Good science is sign of its limits, but even prophets racionálních expectations skromností usually nepřekypovali.</seg>
<seg id=1769> Vernon Smith is leading figures development experimental economics, ideas that in forth by environment can be needs a range of economic tezí.</seg>
<seg id=1770> One reason why the economy so challenging discipline and why among economists there is so much friction, is that economists cannot run controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg id=1771> Nature while directly, too, natural experiments, but in most cases are so fast changing things that are often difficult to determine what incited what.</seg>
<seg id=1772> In principle, it is that in the laboratory can be controlled experiments and to draw more reliable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=1773> Critics experimental economics warn that subjects comes into experimental situations ways of thinking that are conditioned by setting out experiment, and that attempts thus not clean and conclusions important as in natural science.</seg>
<seg id=1774> Economic experiments but to avoid overtake the nature of important processes and events and, for example, help improve the rules dražeb.</seg>
<seg id=1775> It is important that iracionalita because of the market, which was subject to kahnemanova research, was in the laboratory contexts repeatedly prokázána.</seg>
<seg id=1776> To zábavnějším results, to produce experimental economy, belongs to the findings of altruism and self-interest.</seg>
<seg id=1777> It seems (at least in experimentálním environment) that Trial subjects are not as selfish how economists imagine - with the exception of a single groups, and that the economists.</seg>
<seg id=1778> This is because economics as scientific discipline more because of the individual, who are from nature sobečtější, or because it is formed economics and makes them sobečtější individual?</seg>
<seg id=1779> The truth is almost certainly somewhere in the middle.</seg>
<seg id=1780> The question of relative importance of these two hypotéz will likely to other experimental research.</seg>
<seg id=1781> The Nobel is a testament to the, it is important to study the people and the economy as they are, and not as we are they wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1782> Let us hope that better understanding on the human behavior, we will be able to come with such a policy, which will be better to work economy.</seg>
<seg id=1783> The Bush nečestná energy policy</seg>
<seg id=1784> On one of the surreálnějších meetings of the world economic Forum in Davos as the experts on oil industry that polárního polar ice sheets -- are taking place faster than expected -- is not only the problem, but also an opportunity: the can lead to for large reserves of oil.</seg>
<seg id=1785> As these experts on concede that the United States - Convention for the marine law -- the international Convention introducing, who has access to oil under the ocean day and rights to other minerals breed from the sea -- represents a risk of international conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786> But these same experts point to the redeeming lining: the oil industry may not in never-ending search for other supplies prosit Congress for the right zplundrovat aljašku.</seg>
<seg id=1787> President George W. Bush has záhadnou ability to ignore the things in the broader picture.</seg>
<seg id=1788> With over the years is run clear that, with its energy policy is many wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1789> It is so powerful rukopis oil industry, even Bush leaders of one's previous bill that the "nezapomněl on no lobbistu."</seg>
<seg id=1790> Bush has been touted the merits of a free market, but also too readily gives huge charity energetickému sector, although countries with sharp boost to the deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1791> In the energy market is failing, but government intervention should go precisely the opposite direction, that the Bush administration is proposing a.</seg>
<seg id=1792> Given the fact that Americans are full of the price for the air pollution -- in the form of its increase of to establish greenhouse gases -- that is the result of their profligate energy consumption is the price of energy podhodnocena, further keeps excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1793> What is needed is the government to stimulate conservation, and interventions in the price system -- through taxes on energy -- an effective means to achieve this end.</seg>
<seg id=1794> Yet Instead Bush supported conservation, a policy of "first vysát America," deepening future America's dependence on foreign oil.</seg>
<seg id=1795> For him, drives the demand that high oil prices up, which is the gift from heaven for many people in the Middle East, who do not belong among friends America.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush finally awakened into reality widening American dependency; with strmému rising oil prices, it is hard to could nevšimnout consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1797> Klopýtavé steps his administration, however, in this case almost certainly situation in the immediate future will only worsen.</seg>
<seg id=1798> Conservation still Bush refuses to anything make and its continuing prayers to US zachránily technology supported the very little money.</seg>
<seg id=1799> So what about the Bush recently vyhlášeném commitment to cut the 25 years dependence of the United States in the Middle East oil about 75%?</seg>
<seg id=1800> For investors the message is clear: neinvestujte more in the development of reserves in the Middle East, which are far from nejlevnějším source of oil in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1801> Without new investment in the development of Middle Eastern oil and given the bezuzdnému energy consumption growth in the US, China, and elsewhere, however, demand předběhne supply.</seg>
<seg id=1802> And as would, the pohrůžka sanctions against Iran with a risk of from one of the world's largest producers.</seg>
<seg id=1803> At a time when the world oil production is close to the maximum kapacitě and prices are already more than a double dip over the war in Iraq, this věstí another of price increases and other improving the profits of the oil industry -- one clear winner of the Middle East politics.</seg>
<seg id=1804> Of course, Bush cannot be the post-Confucians, finally realized that the existence of the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805> A close look at his proposals, however, as always reveals further eskamotérský trick his administration.</seg>
<seg id=1806> In addition to refusal to recognize the severity of global warming, encouraging conservation and enough resources to research that something really changed means Bush's grandiózní promise to reduce the dependence on Middle East oil less than it seems.</seg>
<seg id=1807> From the Middle East, comes only 20% of oil used in the US, and so can be his goals to achieve a only small steps by shifting demand elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=1808> One man at the same time, the Bush administration must recognize the mechanisms of global trade with oil.</seg>
<seg id=1809> Indeed, even if America was on Middle East oil certainly independent, reducing the supply of Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world prices -- and thus on the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810> And as in the Bush administration is often, for the official strategy, there is no lichotivé explanation.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Does Bush only policy and trying to pander antiarabskému and antiíránskému sentiment in America?</seg>
<seg id=1812> Or is it only another example of incompetence and tumult?</seg>
<seg id=1813> According to what we in the last five years saw the right answer is likely to be more than a small amount of nečestnosti and sheer folly.</seg>
<seg id=1814> China's Road Map</seg>
<seg id=1815> China is poised to take their September pětiletku and to prepare the way for the probably nejpozoruhodnější economic transformation in history and improve the wealth of almost quarters of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id=1816> The world has such a persistent growth hasn't; never happened to significant reduction of poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1817> Part of a prescription for long-term China's success is almost a unique combination of pragmatism and vision.</seg>
<seg id=1818> While much of the rest of the developing world that is regulated by the Washington Consensus, was to donkichotskému efforts to higher GDP, China once again made it clear that it is a sustainable and fairer increased real living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1819> China recognizes that have entered stage of economic growth, who bears environment which -- and unsustainable -- claims.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Absent to change course, it will eventually to the detriment of living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1821> This is why the new pětiletka places much emphasis on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822> Many backward part of China, pace that would probouzelo surprises, were it not for the fact that other parts of the country, even prudčeji.</seg>
<seg id=1823> Although the process of reduces poverty, inequality is on the rise, given the growing differences between city and rural areas and already regions and vnitrozemím.</seg>
<seg id=1824> This year's World Development Report issued by the World Bank explains why the US should zneklidňovat not only poverty and inequality and September Five-Year Plan China, the problem is in advance.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The government for several years talk about harmoničtější society and the pětiletka a ambitious programs for achieving this targets.</seg>
<seg id=1826> China have also knows that what less developed countries from the developed countries, it is not only the gap in resources, but also a gap in our knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827> So rozvrhla bold plans not only on the narrowing of this gap, but also to create a bases for separate innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828> China's role in the world and in the world economy is changing, and plan that also reflects.</seg>
<seg id=1829> Its next growth, it will have to more in a domestic demand than on exports, which will require increase in consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830> Indeed, China has nezvyklý problem: the excessive savings.</seg>
<seg id=1831> People set aside in part because of the shortcomings of government social insurance programs. The social jistot (pensions) and public health and education will reduce the social inequality, will support among citizens of the sense of affluence and at the same time, the current consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1832> If these measures successful -- and has been China almost always overcome and their own high expectations -- could develop enormous pressure on the global economic system, whose balance already compromise the massive US fiscal and trade imbalances.</seg>
<seg id=1833> If China less save -- and if, as oznámili officials, has a diverse policy investment reserves -- who will finance the US trade deficit of $2 billion a day?</seg>
<seg id=1834> This is an issue on sometimes sometimes, but it must not be a distant sometimes.</seg>
<seg id=1835> With such a clear vision of the future will challenge its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1836> China is great countries and without large decentralization could not succeed as it has forged.</seg>
<seg id=1837> But decentralization has its own problems.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Greenhouse-gas limits, for example, are global problem.</seg>
<seg id=1839> While America says that cannot afford to do anything to do, senior Chinese officials campaign zodpovědněji.</seg>
<seg id=1840> Within months since the pětiletky have been established new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline and products from dřeva: China to their own and global environmental problems has used the market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id=1841> The pressures on the representatives of local governments, in order to ensure the economic growth and jobs, however, will be immense.</seg>
<seg id=1842> They will find themselves in the temptation to argue that if to produce in ways that protects the planet cannot even America, as we this could afford we?</seg>
<seg id=1843> Their vision of přetavila in actions, the Chinese government will need strong political programs, such as already established environmental taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1844> As China near to market economy, there have some ills in advanced countries: interest groups, subtle veils of market ideology journey calculating arguments.</seg>
<seg id=1845> Some argue opřenou economy on the theory of the "stékání wealth": the poor, nestarejte, growth will eventually benefit all.</seg>
<seg id=1846> Others will build against competition policy and strict laws in the formal sector firms: whether we its miracles by the Darwinian survival of the most powerful.</seg>
<seg id=1847> Will be provided growth arguments to kontrovat powerful social and environmental policies: higher taxes on gasoline dead, our emerging auto industry.</seg>
<seg id=1848> Such supposedly prorůstové policy would not only failed to achieve growth, but ohrozily would the vision of China's future.</seg>
<seg id=1849> There is the only way to avoid the: open debate economic policies, which is intended to reveal deceptive conclusions and open up space for creative solution many fundamental problems that China today.</seg>
<seg id=1850> George W. Bush has proved danger excessive secretive and reducing decision-making on the narrow circle patolízalů.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Most people outside of China not entirely doceňuje to what extent, its leaders, in contrast to Bush, pustili to large-scale deliberation and broad consultation (and even with foreigners), in order to address the extraordinary problems that before them is.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Market economies are not samoregulační.</seg>
<seg id=1853> They cannot be simply to autopilotovi, especially if we want to their benefits widely shared.</seg>
<seg id=1854> A market economy, however, is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id=1855> It is a art to balance and is constantly to respond to economic change.</seg>
<seg id=1856> China's 9 / pětiletka represents a road map such responses.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The world that follows with úžasem and hope for the lives of 1.3 billion people remain transformují.</seg>
<seg id=1858> Democratic lessons from tocquevilla</seg>
<seg id=1859> It seems to be entirely on the ground, that because the Iraq War world 200 years after the birth of alexise de tocquevilla being debated nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Tocqueville right proslul by refused to a reactionary nostalgia and for our fate as a victory for democracy, but also warned nebezpečími that democracy for freedom means.</seg>
<seg id=1861> We should its fears still share?</seg>
<seg id=1862> Tocqueville, democracy is not only a political regime, but above all the intellectual regime that generally formed habits society, it sociologický and psychological dimension.</seg>
<seg id=1863> Democratic regimes, he argued Tocqueville, define our ideas, desires, and passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864> As there renesanční one and in the twentieth century homo sovieticus, "one democratic" is a form of human beings.</seg>
<seg id=1865> According to the tocquevilla would systemic effects of democracy could lead to a loss of citizens zdůvodněného thinking.</seg>
<seg id=1866> They could only to pretend that events and values are reviewing what people; in fact, would only kopírovali gross and zjednodušené views masses.</seg>
<seg id=1867> What Tocqueville called by keeping their "social" power over sentiment is really in democratic regimes, perhaps the most powerful -- his perspective predicts increase in the current demagoguery and media manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=1868> Tocqueville was convinced that this tendency has no effective long-term limits.</seg>
<seg id=1869> The decline of the critical thinking that, it seems, democracy is it can prevent even local democracy or small companies, or government checks and balance or civil rights.</seg>
<seg id=1870> Schools have the capacity to be little more than a settler enclave protected before leptavou force social influences affecting the mind.</seg>
<seg id=1871> Similarly, while the Tocqueville thought that efforts to virtue à la antických nations or to religious faith can sometimes soul to, both conflicts with the democratic ideálem, if it in public life officially předepsáno.</seg>
<seg id=1872> In this sense, between tocquevillovi schools heir apparent belongs neomarxističtí theorists frankfurtské schools and Hannah arendtová, who equally feared dismantling of convenience in modern societies.</seg>
<seg id=1873> The French philosopher marcel gauchet even his recent book a democracy itself.</seg>
<seg id=1874> Democratic way of life, they claim writers, tend to destroy an authentic thinking and curb "high" culture, so that poddává tuctovosti, in which as a result of citizens susceptible to the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875> But, while are histories of bloody regimes opěvovaných zastrašenými and podvedenými masses, greater risk for democratic states is that their citizens stáhnou in apathy and the short thinking zaměřeného on gratification of momentálních needs.</seg>
<seg id=1876> The past is -- despite rituals, which seeks to remind moments in history -- zahlazována návykem on what is now and what is new.</seg>
<seg id=1877> This okouzlení falling and supposedly well educated ruling class.</seg>
<seg id=1878> The fundamental problem democratic sentiment is the lack of historical consciousness.</seg>
<seg id=1879> Indeed, kazy democracy, as Tocqueville, argued that the only -- realistic, but unsustainable -- way, after that we can go, is rezignovaný pessimism?</seg>
<seg id=1880> Think so.</seg>
<seg id=1881> There are ways to fight against what might be called the "democratic hloupostí" today.</seg>
<seg id=1882> The first defense is to promote educational system, which really formed critical thinking, especially through (in today's time) zanedbávaných objects: literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883> If informed, and critical civil base that democracy requires, our schools must stop pander the last fashionable waves and start bystřit analytické ability students.</seg>
<seg id=1884> The biggest obstacle of education are mass media, with their prone to plytkost and fun.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Many people now spent much of the life of a television than in školních lavicích.</seg>
<seg id=1886> Passivity, mass media are growing, is naprostým the opposite to active engagement, democratic citizens need.</seg>
<seg id=1887> But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (except the quality of newspapers) from their own will become an instrument of education, which have been critical faculties citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1888> Concern over masmédii is not just a elitářským opovržením popular culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889> The question is not popularity itself -- after all Mozart was a popular and shakespearovy of the game líbily poor and rich -- but in the reluctance of mass culture question and provoke.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The result of this failure is universal indifference and passivity its.</seg>
<seg id=1891> Globalizovaná media culture, ineffective as exists to the art of critical thinking and waking up povznesené feelings, has long been on the rise.</seg>
<seg id=1892> It is a culture that its neglect threatened by democratic freedom, because it cannot create a sense of the obligation -- to society, to history, to the community.</seg>
<seg id=1893> It is too late to do something with culture, which umrtvuje souls?</seg>
<seg id=1894> Tocqueville pohrdal elites of their time for their complacency in the face of vykořeňující power mass democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1895> A short-sightedness, our leaders also as a force for a his get excited about prophecy?</seg>
<seg id=1896> Europe for all</seg>
<seg id=1897> Long serving members of the European Union now, it seems, the future of the Union, but we in Ukraine, the European Union hledíme with hope and obdivem.</seg>
<seg id=1898> To join the development of the EU is the main meta our foreign policy, Ukraine discovered that státnost is the ultimate goal, but the.</seg>
<seg id=1899> European unity is indeed indivisible: if one nation ostracized, not all free.</seg>
<seg id=1900> We Europeans we obepnuti inevitable networks, oděni in a common roucha fate.</seg>
<seg id=1901> To make all aspects of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Anything will shift one evropana directly, dotkne with other indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903> Never we cannot afford to live with narrow the idea of two evrop, the wealthy and the nemajetné, those inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id=1904> No one who live on the European continent, cannot -- indeed, must not -- be regarded as foreigners in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905> This is the depends today's spectacular Pax europa and today's celoevropská prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1906> Of course, some bručí that Ukraine is Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907> So no přijedou into Kiev and promluví with those young and old, with továrními workers, manželkami farmers, with lawyers, doctors and teachers, who in the winter without ustání stood for weeks in zero and Snow and vydrželi to defend their freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1908> Are perhaps svázáni with those who alongside General de Gaulle in the French odboji?</seg>
<seg id=1909> They do not agree with those who in the 1930's, died in fighting for it Republic, who in 1956 liberated budapešť and in the 1970's skoncovali with fascism in Spain and Portugal?</seg>
<seg id=1910> Nedodává them the vibrancy of the same spirit as Polish solidarity and peaceful masses rather than encouragement meant that pražskou Velvet Revolution in 1989?</seg>
<seg id=1911> This is true European spirit and no doubt it nerozdrtí.</seg>
<seg id=1912> Those who say that Ukraine is for EU membership too challenged, odpovídám: přijeďte also in my country, whether you mothers that remain in the long into the night to their children to use the computer, which they have in employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913> Přijeďte into language schools in every village and in any city, where the young people are preparing to Europe and learn the French, German and English.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Those who question the European dispozice Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a matter of technical equipment and superdálnic; it is neuhasitelnou desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915> I believe that our future is as particularly hopeful about its, as it is past Europe vznešená, and that our fate is not be zapomenutou border neklidného the region, but a shaper of and budovatelem European peace and European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1916> Self-determination has not isolation, because to achieve national independence currently does not mean more than the return on the world stage with new Charter.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The new countries can with its former by the occupiers create as fruitful relations, as it has built France with Germany -- the relationship based on equality and bilateral interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918> This is the relationship, about what my government seeks with Russia, and its successful creating a is what we can contribute to the expansion of the zone of European peace.</seg>
<seg id=1919> Of course, it is too early to do more than giving their great respect, with which we regard the prospect of membership in the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1920> We know that our share of the big building exists overnight.</seg>
<seg id=1921> We know that great results of European unification nespočívají in documents and deklaracích, but in novátorském holding scheduled to zlepšovalo lives and provides security all Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1922> To build Ukraine value membership in the EU will not be easy, cheap or rapid.</seg>
<seg id=1923> But it will be created and succeeds, as the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1924> We recognize that it is a huge task, but the resulting reward for the námahu and Europe should know that this is our goal.</seg>
<seg id=1925> Part of the efforts of Ukraine's recovery is creative for the battle for an end to the terrifying century, in which the rval domination of fascism and communism, ideology zrozené in the heart of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1926> A few months ago our children and their parents in cities across Ukraine face an armed soldiers, vrčícím psům, indeed, and death.</seg>
<seg id=1927> A few years ago, nájemnými murderers former regime struck with and sťat young žurnalista heorhij Gongadze, who tried to the public to inform the corruption of the regime.</seg>
<seg id=1928> Our Orange Revolution of this winter, shows that Ukraine's people won.</seg>
<seg id=1929> So, despite today's doubt and difficulty in Europe uchovávám permanent confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1930> I accept the despair as the ultimate response to quandaries and dread Ukraine's history.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I accept the notion that Ukraine is so have tied to the bezhvězdnou půlnocí's legacy that can never see the dawn of peace and true European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1932> When wanted to EU citizens of Ukraine's place in Europe, they should be a closer look at face, who see, and also have to look deeper for this.</seg>
<seg id=1933> Should the see deeper than on vypleněnou pustinu inherited after communism and on poverty and social divisions, through which to overthrow former leaders to prolong their devastating governance.</seg>
<seg id=1934> Instead, should face to face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, Haiti's degraded during the election campaign jedem, and to recall words skvělého andrého the malrauxe, for which "nejkrásnější faces are those that were poraněny."</seg>
<seg id=1935> Muslim Civil War</seg>
<seg id=1936> It is now schism between Sunni and Shi'a in the Middle East deeper than hostility between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg id=1937> Given the response some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel, this one might think.</seg>
<seg id=1938> Although the Israeli bombs dopadaly in the city of Beirut and Tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps nejkonzervativnější Arab Muslim state, openly condemned of the Shi'a Hezbollah, which supposedly launched a conflict with Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1939> In history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is not that the state, which is regarded as leader of the Arab Muslim nations, so openly boosted Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1940> Saúdskoarabská split with Hezbollah is not one-time affairs.</seg>
<seg id=1941> Also Egypt and Jordan directly doomed the Hezbollah and its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah for avanturismus.</seg>
<seg id=1942> What lies behind this an astounding development?</seg>
<seg id=1943> We are seeing fundamentálního shift in relations between the Arab nationalism and Islamic sektářstvím?</seg>
<seg id=1944> It is Sunni government Saudi Arabia znepokojenější and zděšenější Shia Islam in more than in what is genuinely committed to encouraging Arab unity, and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg id=1945> Judging Hezbollah Arabs suggests that sektářský schism Muslims, which is already in a daily violence in Iraq, in the Middle East is magnifies the.</seg>
<seg id=1946> The desire to US President George W. Bush to zamrzlé society of the Arab world it was meant, so that the modernizing forces to the traditional prvkům in the Arab and Islamic society.</seg>
<seg id=1947> Instead, it seems that Bush he has gone on a longer leash nejatavističtější forces in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1948> Open this pandořiny skříňky began with a new and perhaps even ošklivější era zevšeobecňujícího violence, which may be as other than as "Muslim civil war."</seg>
<seg id=1949> The conflict between the Shi'a and Sunnis there is from the dawn of Islam, but geography and ethnic isolation nearabského Shi'ite Iran, together with the rule of the Sunni Arabs over the Shiite minorities in other countries maintain this rivalry, the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1950> This tensions further ochabla in the flow of "Islamization" caused by the Iranian revolution, because sectarian identity Sunni Arabs was immediately after zatlačena into the background and instead has emerged as a universal "Islamic" asertivita.</seg>
<seg id=1951> All of this changed in September 2001, when al-Qaeda, Sunni terrorist force that strongly draws from Saudi wahhábistické ideology, to take attacks on the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1952> Suddenly, walking on the specificky Sunni form of militantního Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1953> When the United States triggered war as the Sunni the Taliban in Afghanistan, so the Sunni Iraqi regime has given that this new radical Sunni odnoži even more kuráž.</seg>
<seg id=1954> Sunni Arabs in the region, who find new self-esteem, they see Israel and the West as a mere one threat, while the second represents a so-called "the Shiite půlměsíc" -- srpkovitý raw deal pevniny spreading from Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq to Iran and obývaný supposedly kacířskými Shi'a.</seg>
<seg id=1955> Saudi rulers as opatrovníci nejsvětějších jobs Muslim faith in Mecca and medině feel this threat perhaps nejostřeji.</seg>
<seg id=1956> Viewed by sunnitskýma our eyes Shia not only by oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq, and Eastern Saudi Arabia, but are trying to -- through actions Hezbollah -- usurp the role of the "protectors" central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cases.</seg>
<seg id=1957> Saudi Arabia's Kingdom has turned its back to Hezbollah because the Saudi royal family deriving its legitimacy from strict forms of Sunni Islam and doubts loajalitě their Shiite people.</seg>
<seg id=1958> Ironically, it is the United States as a longtime protectors Saudi Arabia, which to strengthen the Shia by toppled Saddam Hussein and brought Shiite parties in Iraq to power.</seg>
<seg id=1959> It appears that the Bush administration knows what is made, while the Shiite arch to the East Arab in the Muslim world, the rise of, the US tries to enhance their protection Sunni oblouku -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in the western part of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1960> Israel, this druhdy nesmiřitelný enemy Arab things, as would now in the defense structures zapadl.</seg>
<seg id=1961> Such a defensive status, however, must be given panarabskému sentiment invariably unstable.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Now they are ordinary Saudis přilepeni to obrazovkám with vysíláním TV station Al Jazeera and other Arab satelitních networks and watch events in Gaza and southern Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id=1963> They see how is prolévána Arab (not Shi'ite) blood and armed resistance put the only Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1964> In their eyes, so he Hezbollah hrdinným example of the resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965> In the Saudi state as a result, the deepening schism between Sunni and Shi'a.</seg>
<seg id=1966> After official condemnation of Hezbollah called the Saudi Arabia's its official wahhábistické spiritual to fatwu condemning Hezbollah as a Shi'ite devianty and will.</seg>
<seg id=1967> Such a conviction, however, can only vyostřit sektářský the schisms within the Saudi Arabia and in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id=1968> Reached Sunni regimes as this antagonism to believe that need their own Hezbollah, which would fought in their corner ringu?</seg>
<seg id=1969> If such a conclusion do it may not seek a long, because many such fighters has been vycvičeno -- the Al káidou.</seg>
<seg id=1970> Georgia at the heart of Europe</seg>
<seg id=1971> The era, when Europe could rely on America with leadership wars, in assuring peace and creating democracy on its own backyard, is behind us.</seg>
<seg id=1972> Enlargement of the European Union has shown that backyard, as the recent crisis around Russian gas, now includes not only Ukraine, but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973> Georgia, as well as Ukraine, is a test of democracy, Europe cannot afford to ignore.</seg>
<seg id=1974> Georgia was the first postsovětskou countries that implements its "barevnou revolution" and the demonstrated by its, with dignity and vyspělostí that its people have opted for democracy and European values.</seg>
<seg id=1975> Flags of the European Union that since then, třepotají on all where Georgian public buildings, showing natural, as old as the country's history, which was for ancient River part and parcel of the then a familiar world.</seg>
<seg id=1976> Prométheus, médeia, amazonky and in neighboring Armenia noemova ark -- the beginnings of Europe our myths are there.</seg>
<seg id=1977> For its history, culture, and traditions -- including the critical, an independent, and vzdorovitého spirit within the former Soviet Union -- it seemed that Georgia is the best candidate to democratization.</seg>
<seg id=1978> So it is the more worrying that the democratization troskotá.</seg>
<seg id=1979> Everything seemed to start his own fairly look promising.</seg>
<seg id=1980> With resistance, encountered, political reform, privatization, anti-corruption norms, efforts to find new leaders neposkvrněné concessions to minulému regime or out of foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=1981> Between leaders who claiming that represent the will of the majority, most more and more power, but naturally totalitarian approaches.</seg>
<seg id=1982> Georgia's political elite, like starořecké hydře, constantly die and developing.</seg>
<seg id=1983> These same people and methods of governance, whose potření "Rose Revolution" of November 2003 them, again objevili in ohnisku power through their personal connections that extend beyond the Georgian borders, and its obrovitého wealth and softly vycizelovaného umu political pletich and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=1984> This has to do with the nature of democracy, which is based on the voting urnách, but also on the division of power.</seg>
<seg id=1985> The government interfered with a parliament, which in turn to intervene in decision-making government -- in my case, for example, to nomination velvyslanců and their daily working responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1986> Finally, the most serious is that the judiciary is not yet independent, which undermines the rule of law, and thus away urgently needed private investment.</seg>
<seg id=1987> Georgia's democracy has taken hold, but not body: people continue to spurn policy as immoral ugly, so fields abandoning those who have long should retire retirement.</seg>
<seg id=1988> But doufání in democracy remains highly embedded in Georgia's people, civil society organizations, and in the media.</seg>
<seg id=1989> It is time to Europe for the hope that this nevyhasne.</seg>
<seg id=1990> The US is no longer in Georgia since independence has done for the support of political stability, what only could.</seg>
<seg id=1991> To be sure, during the government of Edvard Shevardnadze, former foreign minister of the Soviet Union, which we as its president expelled, stability not always appealed with democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1992> But the Americans generous invest in the survival of the democratic ideas and leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1993> Although the supported by finančníkem George sorosem růžovou revolution nevykonstruovala, they Russian nationalists, the conditions that democracy requires pečovala, stimulate is and help them.</seg>
<seg id=1994> But if aid or Georgian democracy, the country needs now support different nature, to carry providing is better vybavena Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1995> Models balance of power, the functioning of the judiciary and local democracy must inspire a European models that are Georgian reality than Anglo Saxon common-law models American-style.</seg>
<seg id=1996> The rejection of the challenges posed by Europe would mean a betrayal of its elementárních duty in place -- a small, středozemském, flexibilním, with the old Historical traditions -- where democracy much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both enormous and still sovětsky to, Central Asia, not to mention.</seg>
<seg id=1997> Indeed, neposkytnutí support Georgian democracy that struggle with the nepřízní, would most likely odročilo democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus and in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1998> This raises the stakes clearly.</seg>
<seg id=1999> Russia, while never nevzdalo its Imperial Dreams and tools dominance, but the evening's smiřovat with the inevitability of democracy, at least for their at.</seg>
<seg id=2000> Hesitant acceptance of some normality in relations with its neighbors, however, has always been vulnerable to náhlému explosion celebrated irrational Russian "děržavy" -- aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and promote its power vrháním on weakness.</seg>
<seg id=2001> Here is the key to understanding of the recent Russian gas crisis.</seg>
<seg id=2002> Equally clear is that every sign of departure from democracy in Georgia and other postsovětských states will only and bring the neo-imperial ambitions Russia.</seg>
<seg id=2003> It is a European responsibility to persuade Russia that a return to the past is hopeless impossible.</seg>
<seg id=2004> Europe must play its part not only to secure energy supplies of independence in the future, but also to showed that European values freedom, democracy, and justice between nations have real power.</seg>
<seg id=2005> If it is to succeed, Europe needs to make the necessary tools: a big poloveřejnou foundations for the promotion of Europe and the support of political reform, univerzitou, where vyškolí future leaders of the emerging democracy, the police by an electoral and military judges and judicial officials, who vdechnou life into models that want to follow.</seg>
<seg id=2006> Europe, above all, needs belief.</seg>
<seg id=2007> If today's Europe cannot convince itself that has a vital interest in the future of their neighbors, who will come to believe in Europe?</seg>
