<seg>Our declaration of the rights is the first which way this millenium.</seg>
<seg>Let us can organize itself to Fifteen in order to be able to accomodate under right conditions the countries which strike with our door.</seg>
<seg>The basic services sector public of social, cultural and caritative interest must be mentioned again in article 87 so that these important institutions can profit from a sustainable protection.</seg>
<seg>Some think that one can create an interior market in Europe without agreeing on values and fundamental principles.</seg>
<seg>I want to greet, in my turn, the strong and substantial intervention of president Prodi.</seg>
<seg>You know there that it is a question of a deliberate choice which was made in Amsterdam, of distinguishing the two functions well. The high representative, contrary to the Commission, does not express himself in all independence, but it has the role of coordinating the foreign policies and of security policy which are competence of the Member States and there we must perhaps leave a broad place to the intergovernmental one.</seg>
<seg>It wished that the presidency trace in Nice the way for the future.</seg>
<seg>One can indeed wish more and better, but I believe very honestly that it is a good start.</seg>
<seg>I hope since the European Council of Nice will endorse this project and will decide to concretely begin it as a project and not like accomplished fact, after having obviously adopted the reforms which are essential.</seg>
<seg>I however as said clearly as in the current location, we could achieve extremely important goals by the Community way, such as for example a more effective action in Balkans.</seg>
<seg>It is only by binding Russia to the Occident and the European Union that we will be able to have an influence on its policy and to maintain the contact and the dialogue with it.</seg>
<seg>Motion for resolutions (B5-0767/00) Misters Napolitano, in the name of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Charter of Fundamental of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Per hour that it is, it continues this genocide and tries moreover to reduce to nothing the freedom of the press and the Rule of law which hardly exist in this country.</seg>
<seg>To try to meet waitings of this pensioner, who is called Giuseppe Italia, lives in Crémone and would wish to sail on Po, I have Piecyk voting in favour of the report on development of seaports maritime, of the inland ports interior and on the intermodal nuds.</seg>
<seg>The result of the vote of this Parliament prohibited achieving the goal of the directive, however admitted and approved by the whole of the speakers and the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I have Skinner voting in favour of the report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that the venture capital is important.</seg>
<seg>My party colleague Armonie Bordes underlined yesterday in sour terms that only a minority benefits from the engagement of Community funds and contributions to the case of the retirements for the entrepreneurial risk.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the Charter will be used more to devote the current practices, including retrograde, of the Nation states that to represent a progress.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, we have finally a Charter of Fundamental of the European citizens whose whole article, article 25, is dedicated to the elderly.</seg>
<seg>This text can initially appear painless, since it takes again existing rights essentially. But if it were incorporated in the treaty with binding force, like the European Parliament asks it, it would tend mechanically, with time, with the standardization of the national laws in Europe; it would grant a disproportionate capacity to the Court of justice; it would support a centralization increased around the European institutions; it would limit the autonomous margin of decision of each people.</seg>
<seg>· It is necessary to avoid overloading the Charter with detailed regulations and leaving the care of those with the secondary legislation.</seg>
<seg>I will vote for another charter while taking part in the demonstrations of Biarritz, the 13 and October 14, and of Nice, on December 7, 2000.</seg>
<seg>Progress towards accession of the 12 candidate countries</seg>
<seg>I think that a certain number of Member States did not seize the existence of this bond yet to date and did not understand that a hesitant progression of the intergovernmental Conference could raise enormous difficulties to us in order to impose widening within the necessary delays.</seg>
<seg>We will not be able to impose, in the long term, all from which I come to speak up to now that if the political world and the elites of the candidate countries and the European Union - and, in this respect precise good, I give you reason, Mister the Police chief - finally state that the enlargement of the European Union benefits this one.</seg>
<seg>It is the devoted formula.</seg>
<seg>Allow me to now evoke the second orientation whereby the presidency wishes to make evolve/move during this six-month period the process of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>What I thus propose to you, it is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, from the point of view of 2003, which are the candidates who are ready to join us on this date.</seg>
<seg>I thank the rapporteur for the Committee for the foreign affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and complete report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>The object of the negotiations is not to in no case “if”: it is question of “how” and of “when”.</seg>
<seg>But they also did it because the prospect of membership with the European Union their fact of hoping for the solidarity between nations Europeans and that it offers a political and economic anchoring to them solid.</seg>
<seg>A certain number of countries have so much quite advanced with regard to the second economic criterion - competitiveness on the interior market - that they approach with great steps of adhesion.</seg>
<seg>We thus seek the closest coordination with the programs of the national governments, the Parliament and other institutions.</seg>
<seg>Each year, and will be we there soon again - on November 8 -, all the candidate countries await the judgement impatiently that the Commission pronounces on their progress.</seg>
<seg>We chose with reason for the principle of the differentiation, according to which each candidate country is evaluated on the basis of his own merit.</seg>
<seg>This debate is an additional occasion for my group to confirm that the adhesion of the European countries central and Eastern - but also of Cyprus and Malta - best is guaranteed future for us all in Europe, in the East as in the West.</seg>
<seg>The task, which is however capital, did not arouse an lively interest on behalf of the public yet.</seg>
<seg>People joke in connection with the widening which, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, must always intervene in five years only.</seg>
<seg>The next very natural occasion, they will be the European elections of 2009, but we want to make efforts so that a maximum of country can adhere since 2004.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, six other fundamental issues worry us because of the followed method.</seg>
<seg>Actually, it is the model even of European construction in which that we engulfed ourselves, I want to say the simultaneous integration of all the sectors of activity whatever the traditions or the characteristics of the ones and others, which is transformed once again into trap.</seg>
<seg>The expression of this nearly general feeling in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of years 1980 engages us all until today.</seg>
<seg>But, that the things are clear: there cannot be adhesion with the reduction.</seg>
<seg>There is an powerful idea which is also an fine idea: to knowing that we will not make widenings against the opinions and that the best way, indeed, to make widenings with the opinions passes by their participation in elections, since the elections are the expression of the democracy and the method of adhesion of the citizens to the political system.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mesdames and Sirs, I would like to briefly express me as for the conditions making possible the scenario which several speakers wished.</seg>
<seg>You should not forget that these people represent interests.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, I already announced that all the countries approached this point relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg>That means that one already decided the liberalisation of trade in the field of the agricultural products without the Poles not fearing that it results collapse from it from their agriculture.</seg>
<seg>Tensions occurred, but as a whole, peace and the commercial exchanges established between the citizens of the closer relations, which are still reinforced by the monetary Union.</seg>
<seg>It must be the results of the negotiations which count.</seg>
<seg>The only amendment which was deposited for the moment is covered by this report/ratio, but I delighted right now that the Green Group wants to underline the need for an equal treatment of all the citizens.</seg>
<seg>That does not imply only one law in the field of the public service but also to open possibilities of suitable remuneration for the young officials.</seg>
<seg>That is worth as much for Latvia that the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The fastening of the litas to the euro is envisaged during the second half-year 2001.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, Poland, country for which I am rapporteur, is largest and most important but, like also know we it, most problematic of the countries which prepare to adhere to the European Union. To tell the truth, it poses so much problems which one intends to raise of the voices asking for his exclusion of the first group, that of the countries which will join us the first.</seg>
<seg>We did too many promises not held in Poland, with the Eastern European countries, communist in the past countries.</seg>
<seg>Remain a point which returns regularly when it is question of the Czech Republic. It is the problem of Roms.</seg>
<seg>Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that she wants to adhere to the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>I would like finally to allow me a final comment concerning the interior policy.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, and with regard to the agriculture, whose level of productivity remains lower than that of the European Union, it is necessary to completely open the agricultural market with the capital necessary to the privatization of the grounds, with the modernization of the exploitations and the structures of downstream, like with the improvement of the outputs.</seg>
<seg>Bulgaria is in a hurry to join the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg>With chapter of extreme poverty - a problem which touches the Rumanian one since 1990 -, one notes finally real signs of economic progresses under the present government.</seg>
<seg>I wish that these subjects become a priority for the new Parliament which will enter according to here fifteen days and of the new government.</seg>
<seg>But we also underline that the definitive solution, just and durable must fully respect at the same time the relevant resolutions of the Safety advice of the United Nations, which is anything else only the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Malta has moreover stable and functional democratic institutions.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, honourable Members, in the name of the economic commission and monetarist, we want to contribute our share to this debate.</seg>
<seg>Still should they be applied. The European Community law is indeed not only one collection of laws: it must also be a law applied in the Candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>This change poses difficult challenges with the citizens of the candidate countries but also ensures, simultaneously, their future and that their children.</seg>
<seg>I join the speaker who preceded me: it is necessary to give an special attention to the border regions.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, the Commission should not be left for account!</seg>
<seg>The Candidate countries want quickly to be put on the economic path of growth, even if that must be done with the detriment of the nature conservation policy laid down before.</seg>
<seg>On a side like other, we maintained bad habits, the majority related to health.</seg>
<seg>. (ES) Mr. President, widening is essential for the construction of a strong and plain continent of Europe.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament and its Regional Policy Committee, also qualified transport transeuropean networks, are conscious that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectoral Community policies in favour of a global policy of town and country planning.</seg>
<seg>I insist however once again on the fact that the transport infrastructures are of an overriding importance for success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I join you, when you declare that the forthcoming enlargement constitutes the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg>The traditional social values specific to the old planned savings in Central and Eastern Europe were strongly shaken.</seg>
<seg>The EPP does not wish to discharge the candidate countries from the responsibility for the rate/rhythm for progress for the accession process: we cannot announce any date.</seg>
<seg>The second point is the designation of the dates.</seg>
<seg>There is another reason.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly: the positive acceptance of enlargement and its prospects for the various countries and the EU as a whole largely depend - the example of Denmark east there for us to show it - elimination on the social and democratic deficits for the European policy.</seg>
<seg>The populism it is the defamatory epithet which the technocrats give to the popular demand when it is expressed in a direction which is not appropriate to them.</seg>
<seg>Mesdames and Sirs, it is now the hour of the pause and the dinner! We will begin again at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg>We will have, even if that is carried out later on, the same currency for the whole of the continent.</seg>
<seg>These sets of themes cause internal battles in each country.</seg>
<seg>We invite them to fight for another Europe, that of all the people, removed from all these inhuman characteristics, where the people will be Masters of their fate, between them relations of peace, freedom, fraternity, mutually beneficial co-operation will develop.</seg>
<seg>I publicly do the praise of their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Romanian Challenge Appeal, whose seat is located at Birmingham, as well as the work of other Irish organizations supported by a certain number of people of which Daniel O'Donnell, the Irish artist, which promised 1 million books that it collected in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg>The Summit of Nizza must especially establish clearly if and how the EU will be able, on its side, fine being ready in time for this widening.</seg>
<seg>The Poles wonder whether they will still profit from it when they adhere or if they become a country of second category.</seg>
<seg>I nevertheless am convinced that with good will and Union aid, a solution will be found which will make it possible the two communities harmoniously to live and to thrive, as they did during centuries.</seg>
<seg>We were also concerned with the minority problems because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.</seg>
<seg>The condition to be able becoming member of the Union is at the bottom to fill the basic criteria, known as criteria of Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg>The benefit of widening were mentioned and it is one of the topics on the subject of which Lithuania can teach us something.</seg>
<seg>Imagine that they are all like that.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, I also wish to congratulate Misters Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I want especially to confine myself in Slovakia, and more especially with the policy followed towards the minorities.</seg>
<seg>I thus invite you at the time of the forthcoming summit of Nizza to fix a deadline to which you envisage to conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries most advanced on the path to accession, without quoting of name.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to adhere to the Union and, obviously, to make sure that the planning of this help is decentralized even.</seg>
<seg>The dialogue between the social partners, the other civil society groups, the government and the Parliament play in this respect a major role and - as let us note we it - positive.</seg>
<seg>We are finishing the division of Europe in two blocks and not to create a new division.</seg>
<seg>All these elements off appear in the report/ratio of Mrs. the Baroness Nicholson Winterbourne whom I warmly thank in the name of our parliamentary group.</seg>
<seg>In this direction, I believe that the question of Cyprus east, par excellence, that on which will be judged the capacity of Europe to see its political aspect.</seg>
<seg>I live myself close to the Baltic Sea, this sea which constitutes for us a whole environmental problems.</seg>
<seg>The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg>Thus, it was very pleasant to hear that Misters Hänsch, who decided in the name of group PSE, hoped that the Commission would proceed to an proper evaluation of the repercussions of widening, as of the economic impacts if widening would not take place.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, I divide the opinion of our rapporteur, Misters Wuermeling, according to whom the fixing of transitional periods is essential in the interest of the two parts. Moreover, as a deputy of a border region and - as Mrs. Schierhuber - owner of a farm located near the Czech border, I particularly hold so that the creation of close common economic spaces can be controlled without big problems and produces positive results on the two sides.</seg>
<seg>As a social democrat, I would like to underline three points.</seg>
<seg>The EEE which comprises files of the first pillar gives on the one hand to the country businesses candidates the access to the internal market and youth and to the scientists the right to take part in the exchange programmes, but on the other hand, does not oblige the EU yet to extend her aid system to agriculture with these countries.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, it is necessary to say “not” to the concept big-bang which would like that one admits at the same time an major group of country, because that would be in conflict with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, we must do everything for, from here 2003, to prepare the European Union with the process of enlargement in the direction of the splendid speech made by the president of the Commission, Misters Prodi.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, I would like to approach the existing relationship between the Parliament and the Council by underlining the fact that there are enormous delays with regard to the answers to the written questions.</seg>
<seg>It is worrying to see that such facts occur in a country which will use the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I thus ask that the question be returned to the Legal Committee so that it can prepare all that.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, we will discuss today, and to perhaps vote, on three reports/ratios on the whole dealing with this subject, of which two are of my responsibility.</seg>
<seg>All the actors of the food line production would have in fact of gaining there.</seg>
<seg>Safety will cost money all the actors of the food line production.</seg>
<seg>It is thus necessary to follow Mrs. Paulsen and the Commission and to adopt the principle of nondilution to make safe the animal feeds and to really protect the European consumers.</seg>
<seg>The directive of 1999 was indeed thought and it can be prided right now on a success because the taxes could be decreased in a significant way.</seg>
<seg>However, to authorize purely and simply dilution does not constitute a solution.</seg>
<seg>Very quickly, we must insist on amendment 37 concerning dioxane.</seg>
<seg>On this point we are of agreement.</seg>
<seg>Thus, it will result from it that we, the European consumers, we will continue to buy on the worldwide markets of the meat and the milk and derived from those produced starting from animal feeds which do not have any bond with the minimum limits and maximum fixed by the European Union and by a production system of animal feeds which buys raw materials on the international markets, free to mix any principle and made up, before introducing their products on the territory of the Union.</seg>
<seg>We must be able to lay out, for the second reading, of the opinion of the Committee on the way of carrying out the evaluation of the risk.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, it would be malvenu, for example, to adopt amendments 39 and 40, because that would amount removing the possibility, for the Member States, to intervene quickly against dangers which one has suddenly detected.</seg>
<seg>The consumer protection starts already starting from the animal feeds, of the components of animal feeds, the declaration and, finally, official controls.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, honourable Members, the report/ratio of our colleague Mrs. Paulsen relating to the undesirable products in the animal nutrition constitutes an important topic and, like all the important topics, it is highly discussed.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the discussion about this excellent report of Mrs. Paulsen was, on certain points, very charged on the emotional level, and now that this discussion is closed, I think that we must leave the principle that the requirements posed with the food sector animal are certainly strict, but that we will be able to then take care that quality evolves/moves by the mixtures.</seg>
<seg>Individually and jointly, these three proposals aim at filling the considerable gaps which were clarified by the crisis of dioxane.</seg>
<seg>Amendment 33 removes the possibility of re-exporting batches nonin conformity towards the country of origin.</seg>
<seg>I then to either accept the amendments 41,42,43 and 44 which aim at restoring the possibility of diluting, under certain conditions, of the raw materials intended for manufacture of feedingstuffs for animals which are contaminated.</seg>
<seg>Those should be enough, taking into account the engagement which we took to establish, within the framework of the new proposal concerning the food authority, a rapid alert system covering the whole of the products and the food chain.</seg>
<seg>Mister the Byrne Police chief, behind this directive on marketing of compound feedingstuffs for animals, hides, at the bottom, a problem which we know for a long time, namely the question of the open declaration.</seg>
<seg>And only for that, I will have already learned something.</seg>
<seg>Because if we quickly put this measurement in uvre and if we start the codecision procedure quickly, that would constitute certainly an appreciable profit and I am convinced that, relation to the Council, we will present ourselves strong and plain.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, honourable Members, it may be that in the future, of the contaminated raw materials can also enter the composition of feedingstuffs for animals - in any case, that is not to exclude.</seg>
<seg>The scandal of the ESB constitutes the worst known example.</seg>
<seg>The common sense - our rapporteur says it - is obviously to have a label with opened declaration, which gives the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg>I think that the technical skills, as well as the capacity of judgement of the members of the Committee on Agriculture are not any doubt in field of agriculture and of food for animals, in order to release a solution directed towards the practice and applicable which must be applied and included/understood by the farmers and the consumers.</seg>
<seg>Here are for the positive points.</seg>
<seg>It acts there, in my opinion, of one legitimate right to the information which should be satisfied.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, I ask you, in the name of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and in my proper name, to send a message of sympathy on behalf of the Parliament to the families of the victims and to the local authorities both of Brittany and of Marín, town of Galicia, from where are originating the majority in the victims.</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament adopts the resolution)</seg>
<seg>Are there colleagues who oppose the deposit of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg>It is well as that which the rapporteur explained us the things.</seg>
<seg>The majority of its technical proposals deserve to be constant with heat, for example on food safety, the dismantling of the nuclear powerstations of the first generation, environmental protection, the fight against the social dumping, the essential code of conduct of the companies of the West when they work in the East, etc the task is immense, and also absolutely priority.</seg>
<seg>In same time, the difficulties of surmounting remain considerable, in particular on the budgetary term.</seg>
<seg>Widening with thirteen countries modifies not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but it also changes the structure of it since, at the same time the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of regions “underprivileged”.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, it is advisable to hold account owing to the fact that within the candidate countries, an agricultural sector and food competitive will be of a decisive importance for the success of the transformation process and reorganization, because of its economic weight and social high.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, I would wish that the outermost regions, of which 6 out of 7 always appear among 10 the poorest of the EU, profit from the Structural Funds, either on the only criterion of the GDP, but also on geographical indicators, demographic and especially social.</seg>
<seg>Because we refuse it in the interest of the French, we cannot, in conscience, to approve its enlargement to the countries and with the people of the East, hardly released from the communist dictatorship and which cannot still know which technocratic and totalitarian trap they want to enter.</seg>
<seg>We should have at most limited us to a short but dense resolution with regard to the reports/ratios relating to the countries.</seg>
<seg>The current system, made up of assistances, subsidies and quotas, must be replaced by free trade and the adaptation to the market.</seg>
<seg>The importance and the amplitude of the problems that widening causes are not compatible with the double language used in what relates to them within the European Union.</seg>
<seg>For me, speech of widening does not mean to sanction the membership or not certain countries in Europe.</seg>
<seg>Our neighbor resolutely endeavoured during the past decade to fill the accession criteria.</seg>
<seg>Latvia has its place in this enclosure, not only because, overall, its progress gives right to him this “credit of essential confidence” to conclude such a negotiation, but especially, and above all, because it is at it in Europe.</seg>
<seg>I believe that, among the countries which required their adhesion, Poland is the State which deserves more our support, our engagement, since, without very major initiatives of Poland, the fall of Communism would not have taken place and we would not be today here speaking about this problem.</seg>
<seg>That east cannot be not also obvious for the Polish population which remains largely euro-skeptic.</seg>
<seg>I invite Prague to seize this sign, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to take action pursuant and to make to it so that, in.liaison.with this Parliament, these one nationalist era old relics can be abandoned.</seg>
<seg>. (IN) I am pleased with the Wiersma report/ratio on the application to join of Slovakia to the European Union and I share the majority of the conclusions which car the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>On this occasion, I am pleased to address a special safety to the elderly and to reprocessed Bulgarian Republic.</seg>
<seg>I thus do not see any reason so that Romania is not allowed within the European Union, if it continues to progress at the same rate/rhythm and once the Union will have proceeded to the necessary adjustments of its institutional structure and its policies to make regard to enlargement.</seg>
<seg>Whatever the solution concerning the colonists, and God knows if the problem is thorny, like that of the restitution of the grounds on the two sides, which says the report/ratio is too hard not to deserve a reserve.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the application to join of Cyprus to the European Union, established by the Affairs Committee foreign, of the human rights, the security policy and the defense policy, are not great help in this respect.</seg>
<seg>This task will not be easy, being given the absence of good will of the Turkish Cypriot part and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio Stenzel (A5-0243/2000)</seg>
<seg>Misfortune, I was indeed victim of a food poisoning, even if it were light, in the European Parliament, alas.</seg>
<seg>For the whole of these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of the dilution which is proposed by the European commission.</seg>
<seg>We must, in this resolution, to insist near the countries of the ASEM so that they make pressure on the regime Burmese military in order to restore the democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg>We show partiality in our approach and our way of doing.</seg>
<seg>It is not the moment to be hesitant.</seg>
<seg>I would like to mention some important points of the directive.</seg>
<seg>The equal treatment and it not discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg>For this reason we need a legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg>We find ourselves thus now with legal a techniques considerable number of amendments aiming at guaranteeing an equal level of protection against based discrimination on the race on the one hand and based discrimination on the religion, the handicap, the age and the sexual orientation on the other hand.</seg>
<seg>It was necessary to make an effort of balance, of moderation and of good legal technique and his report/ratio reflects - in my opinion - all these qualities.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, they think that the cases of discrimination are not sufficiently numerous to justify a directive.</seg>
<seg>The action plan to the examination does not envisage sufficient resources to replace relevant work of the fifth outline programme - work of which, I hope for it, the continuation will be guaranteed in the other outline programmes - and we must consequently take care of their complementarity.</seg>
<seg>Everyone agrees to say that it is necessary to fight against discrimination, but the difference of opinion when it is a question of knowing how, up to what point and with which means.</seg>
<seg>I on the occasion, in committee, to raise me against the fact that the experts can be also out them ONG and to have nevertheless something to say.</seg>
<seg>We are also very satisfied with the provision of the directive specifying that the equal treatment for the handicapped people also means that the companies are supposed to carry out adaptations on the work place.</seg>
<seg>It is only in this manner that we will succeed in fighting effectively against discriminations in all the sociétale areas of life in Europe.</seg>
<seg>After all, as we teach it the great Anglo-Saxon democracies, racism and discriminations are fought by the liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion of economic freedoms, opinion, expression and association.</seg>
<seg>Thus, we have a proposal which raises homosexuality with the row of sacrament of the marriage.</seg>
<seg>We thus reinforce the positions of the European Union on real situations lived by its nationals in connection with the discrimination and the equal treatment.</seg>
<seg>I also reconsider the question of the religious exemption.</seg>
<seg>My attention was drawn to the potential interpretation of exposed reasons in connection with article 1, which once again can seem a little obscure, if it is only it makes the distinction between the sexual orientation and the behavior.</seg>
<seg>As what discriminations are treated on a hierarchical basis.</seg>
<seg>In New Caledonia one gives a preference on a chromatic basis of the skin.</seg>
<seg>These orientations of the directive, united with the fact that, recently, the directive 2000 was adopted, show the manifest will of the European Union to guarantee an open society, removed from predetermined categories and, especially, scourge of racism which has deep roots in the European history.</seg>
<seg>Those which come to say here that Europe should not adopt of directive stating the values which we all let us please defend are mistaken.</seg>
<seg>Do not touch with these hard gained assets.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, Mesdames and the Deputies, the media must also play a major role in this task.</seg>
<seg>The experiment also showed us that the promotion of legislative measures of fight against discrimination is essential, but that it is not enough.</seg>
<seg>We must certainly avoid confusions paperassières, which will do nothing but purely reduce to Europe to an entity materialist, politically correct, but useless.</seg>
<seg>I find altogether that this Parliament instructed too heavily the legislation, “reticent”, that the European commission had wanted to propose.</seg>
<seg>I will start by thanking the two rapporteurs, Sirs Mann and Cashman, for their completely remarkable texts.</seg>
<seg>I also accept the amendments that you presented in order to stress the importance of the prevention of discriminations and to fight against those.</seg>
<seg>The second category aims at clarifying the text of the Commission proposal and the third consists of a big number of amendments of which the goal is to try to put this proposal in phase with the directive on based discrimination on the race adopted to last June.</seg>
<seg>In particular, amendments 9,10 and 20 propose to remove the reference to based discrimination on the race and the ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg>I then to accept the references which you made, in amendments 21 and 45, with the natural persons and morals like with the nonofficial groupings, because this proposal as regards employment applies only to the individuals.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>You cannot discount the public support for the operations of maintenance of peace if your troops are threatened of died by weapons which we ourselves provided.</seg>
<seg>Thus, in my country, it would be necessary a licence for me to have a shotgun, but not to install me as broker with the back of my garden.</seg>
<seg>Another important point: prohibition to export, promote and market equipment and knowledge used for the practice of torture.</seg>
<seg>This said, I would like naturally to congratulate the rapporteur, my Titley colleague, for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg>We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, with the questions of constraint, but also with the means other than those intended for the military use itself: with disarmament even, with conversion, the reinforcement of the action of the customs authorities and police force and, in addition, in the candidate countries that Misters Wiersma has just mentioned.</seg>
<seg>The control of the financial channel makes increasingly more difficult the skirting of the regulations as regards arms trade.</seg>
<seg>The annual report aims to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg>The European Union currently plans to conclude the project beyond its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year.</seg>
<seg>A methodology and indicators were defined and will be submitted to the forthcoming Council “Seeks”.</seg>
<seg>I thank you, Mister the Police chief.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the problems of SME, we of course took care that, in the outline programme, SME have their share, as envisaged in the budgetary decision.</seg>
<seg>It is at least what arises from the budget debate in Greece and it even should be noticed that those which propose the points of view of the European Union are numerous. Is this true?</seg>
<seg>With regard to multidisciplinarity, I share your feeling.</seg>
<seg>The first is the participation of the EU in the national plans, which it specifically mentioned in its declaration.</seg>
<seg>One could not thus speak about European research area, if we are not, us, persons in charge that of 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, following the effort carried out to entirely engage the appropriations at the end of 1999, the demands for authority at the beginning of this exercise for the financing of new projects were inevitably very reduced.</seg>
<seg>But I repeat that the things were well made by Portugal for the previous period.</seg>
<seg>question nº 2 of (H-0730/00):</seg>
<seg>Lastly, to fix the excises on mineral oils at an high level does not involve a non-observance of the Community regulations as regards competition.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, like knows it Misters MacCormick, when the Member States support an industrial sector given by tax measures, it enfreignent the payments on the State aid, in fact the tax State aid equivalent to subsidies.</seg>
<seg>Nuclear energy, for example, constitutes a very clear example.</seg>
<seg>Subject: Budget line “minority languages” the budget appropriations of the European Union in favour of the minority languages which exist since 1983, did not cease increasing until 1995, year during which they were highest (4 million euros).</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, our colleagues in Parliament know certainly that very important means are affected, in the Structural Funds - and it is new -, with the cultural activities, because with my colleague, Michel Barnier, we attached importance to the fact that the Structural Funds did not invest only in the roads or the airports but also in the human beings.</seg>
<seg>The Commission will thus not formulate new financial commitments the next year.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the concrete proposals of financing, it is not possible for me to give an opinion here, because we must observe the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg>I thought of several possibilities.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary thus that something is done on the matter, because it is about million small and medium-size companies in whole Europe.</seg>
<seg>Does its regulation cover the requirements as regards hunting, for example with the dash, as well as the meat processing intended for personal consumption?</seg>
<seg>If one were to apply this regulation to the meat which one consumes oneself, it would be for the hunters of dashes a bureaucratic catastrophe.</seg>
<seg>I have the intention, after the conclusion of this report, to present proposals aiming improving animal transport and at tackling the problem of the insufficient application of the time limitations of way.</seg>
<seg>We already discussed this question at my meeting with the Green Group.</seg>
<seg>Our question was clear: which are the measurements taken by the Commission?</seg>
<seg>General product safety also obliges the producers to inform the consumers of the risks.</seg>
<seg>The case of Maryam Ayubi is extremely alarming.</seg>
<seg>question nº 14 of (H-0745/00):</seg>
<seg>The attitude of the EU with respect to this ministerial meeting of Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or the level to which the EU should be represented there, will depend on the evolution of the situation in Burma from here in December.</seg>
<seg>A last point.</seg>
<seg>The elections constitute an important step in the participation of Kosovan in the management of their own communities.</seg>
<seg>I can even affirm you that the course of these elections more democratic, was organized more than some of our countries to which I was, either as a participant, or as an observer.</seg>
<seg>But we considered that it was about a beginning and to in no case of the result of the process.</seg>
<seg>He pleads for a more effective control of the arms trade like for a greater transparency.</seg>
<seg>I note now that the number of contracts relating to armaments and their components does not cease increasing each year.</seg>
<seg>We cannot make concrete decisions on the basis of fictitious information, of fictitious realities.</seg>
<seg>The arrangement which consisted in maintaining them together within the same DG should be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg>If these institutions must have the possibility of naming an internal auditor, it will prove perhaps sufficient to impose minimum requirements as regards audit to the Financial Comptroller.</seg>
<seg>The police chief is not unaware of it, this proposal does not achieve the unanimity within this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>We do not have thus anything to object at an independent internal audit service, to which we give today green light via the report/ratio of our colleague van Hulten.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Madam the Police chief, I would like to start by addressing my congratulations to the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>We are of opinion that the modernization of the administration is necessary and urgent.</seg>
<seg>An independent counter-checking is essential to avoid the errors.</seg>
<seg>The money must be spent in a way targeted better and more effective in the future. In naturally, one must better be able to guarantee than the funds are actually spent for purposes to which they were affected by the budgetary matter competent authorities.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the modifications, I would like to still briefly make the following remark: the Commission approves this considering additional.</seg>
<seg>I thus thank you for your proposals and your deliberations.</seg>
<seg>I would like to summarize the proposals for this report/ratio which seem most important to me and most concretely operational. Firstly, the creation of an group of experts, composed of personalities named by the Member States, which must contribute to define minimal parameters of protection of the minors in the mediums; secondly, the creation of a code of self by all the owners of the sector; thirdly, the possibility of encouraging and of making available the devices from filtering as well by television as via Internet.</seg>
<seg>I cannot unfortunately approve the requirements of the liberals.</seg>
<seg>This raises mainly of the legislative power of the Member States and must remain such, which does not exclude however a dialogue for the seeking consensus relating to certain reference values with the way from the dialogue with all the parts concerned at the European level.</seg>
<seg>There does not remain less true about it than it falls, in my opinion, with the parents to take care that their children do not look at this kind of programme.</seg>
<seg>The parents require particularly that one brings an assistance in this field to them, which must include: specific parameters for the protection of the minors in the field of the media which are of application in the space of the entire European Union, the installation and the setting with availability at an affordable price of filtration systems, legal arrangements governings with protection of the minors and the engagement of the responsibility for the media, i.e. companies of diffusion and productive enterprises of programs which they are public or private.</seg>
<seg>Then when I hear, at the time them debates in committee, some to affirm that nothing proves the harmful influence which can have violence in all its forms, on TV, on the children, I am astonished and I use there of an euphemism.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the introduction of a code of self, it is to be noticed, in particular on the technical level, that into certain Member States the broadcasters already introduced codes of adjustment for televisions, which must make it possible to the parents to shut off the current.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>In particular, my report/ratio replaces generalization international valid by restoring the decisions with the Member States.</seg>
<seg>It would be a minimum to authorize this area of freedom to us which is a fundamental right of each European citizen.</seg>
<seg>Certain payments due in 1996, Mr. President, were still not carried out.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Madam the Police chief, Ladies and gentlemen, I wish above all to thank Misters Evans and Mantovani for their work.</seg>
<seg>I recommend this report to the House as well as the tabled amendments by Misters Evans.</seg>
<seg>Our human resources represent our single future in a world where knowledge is what there is more invaluable.</seg>
<seg>It is not with green, white, black books or reds which one solves the problems, but with concrete actions.</seg>
<seg>But Parliament, and it is in its role, the Parliament exerted a pressure so that the researchers are nevertheless included in the text.</seg>
<seg>Today, you visit us European at one crucial moment of future construction.</seg>
<seg>But we know that the process is unfinished and that this incomplétude threat its vitality.</seg>
<seg>The debate, to which each country contributes with its own sensitivity, its traditions, its culture, is the instrument which makes it possible to reveal them, to define them and to specify them.</seg>
<seg>Live the European Parliament! Live the European Union!</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to take care that the women benefit from induced employment, while preventing that reproduce the same inequalities only in the more traditional sectors: less qualified employment, one part time sometimes nonselected, insecure contracts and difficulties of access to the decision-making jobs.</seg>
<seg>The Council will be received a proposal of indicators allowing to measure progress on the matter.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to the equal opportunity consolidates the integrated approach of the equality by the gender mainstreaming and specific guiding lines.</seg>
<seg>I think more particularly of the violences undergone by them, one of the priority topics of my government action, and I know that this topic mobilizes you also particularly.</seg>
<seg>Us know that measurements of conciliation of working life and of family life support in particular women, although it is still necessary to carry out studies of the situation current of the family and part which the woman plays there, who is not any more the traditional role since the company strongly changed, just like the family structure.</seg>
<seg>Certain people, including colleagues of this Parliament, seem sometimes convinced of the opposite, but it is an error.</seg>
<seg>I would like to finish, Mr. President, by saying that the equality starts at the house.</seg>
<seg>I find this position embarrassing and ambiguous, and that deserves, seems to me it, reflexion for the projects that you propose to us, because it is not sure that we end to practice through all that.</seg>
<seg>In this field, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg>The European image of women, that which one discovers with the wire of the pages of our report/ratio, of our directives, tallies badly with these Danish womens who say in their majority not to the euro.</seg>
<seg>I find significant that the report/ratio aims at the introduction of a numerical balance between the men and the women in all the sectors of society, on the job market for example.</seg>
<seg>It is precisely for this reason that the report/ratio missed a major opportunity by completely occulting the marriage and the family.</seg>
<seg>It is there a thing whose commission of the rights of women and equal opportunity should also hold account!</seg>
<seg>We heard that the previous presidency initially restructured then dismantled the ministry for the equal opportunity.</seg>
<seg>The average wages of the women continue to be lower, on average of 28%, compared to those of the men, which contributes to the fact that the women represent the majority of poor people and what makes difficult their participation in society and policy.</seg>
<seg>It is a completely remarkable result.</seg>
<seg>One attends today an impoverishment of the women paid everywhere in Europe, in France also, where 15% of them live nevertheless with less than 3.650 FF per month.</seg>
<seg>All the countries did not follow this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.</seg>
<seg>The history of the women is obviously very long.</seg>
<seg>The candidates should be really helped to bring itself to the level of the community asset.</seg>
<seg>But, on this point, I would wish your contest.</seg>
<seg>It is not nevertheless the case, even if it is about a satisfactory text. After reflecthaving lengthily reflected there, the Legal Committee and interior market chose, after a long debate, not to present amendments.</seg>
<seg>The Legal Committee, after a long debate, estimated that it was not reasonable only hard legal uncertainty six years and that three years, the allowed time, was a time more than suitable so that it is possible to determine, with the adequate resources and an average speed, if there were or not irregularity in a declaration.</seg>
<seg>It is about amendment 15 relating to the fraud.</seg>
<seg>The laid down objective, namely to reach a simplified but qualitative communication, as well as a sufficient flexibility of the basic regulation by improving the recovery procedure and by adapting the provisions as regards presentation to the customs, answers the one of the many requirements of the single European market, and this objective is achieved here since many countries were inspired some to be able to take part quickly in the international commercial exchanges.</seg>
<seg>She thanks the Parliament and more particularly the commission chaired by Mrs. de Palacio for the efforts and the interest authorized - by the Parliament and the commission - within the framework for this file.</seg>
<seg>Official welcomes</seg>
<seg>I would wish that not change the direction of the vote which will be expressed, but it is really necessary to check the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I have Evans voting in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg>It is allowed that the knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition with mobility.</seg>
<seg>We also consider that the Member States must be able to decide themselves, on the whole, of the taxes which they wish to take.</seg>
<seg>I considered it regrettable a little that we are not likely any to obtain a majority compared to the need for formulating an expiry date for storage of documents.</seg>
<seg>. During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had been delighted by inclusion of Article 13 relating to based discriminations on the sex, the race or the ethnic origin, the religion or the philosophical convictions nonsectarian, the handicap, the age and the sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg>My final comment relates to the budget of this program, that is to say 98,4 million euros, amount which is of course insufficient taking into consideration action considered.</seg>
<seg>It arises explicitly from the reasons for the amendment that the directive envisages to intervene in the field of the regulations on the age applied in the Member States, payments which are however completely founded for reasons of genetic psychology and do not have any impact on the lives professional.</seg>
<seg>I also consider that we could do without all that was written in the new article 12 a).</seg>
<seg>As regards the religion/the personal convictions, the EPLP is pleased with the principle of protection proposed in this field.</seg>
<seg>The Christian Democrats estimate, as a whole, welcome the proposed directive on the introduction of general frameworks concerning the non-discrimination in the working life.</seg>
<seg>This is however revealing only of the occupation as a personnel of an internal audit service and not of the financial importance and, consequently, utility of such a service.</seg>
<seg>The EU decided to obtain competences common militaries with an aim of achieving the objectives known as of Petersberg (fight against the crises and search for solutions with the conflicts in-outside territory of the EU), but it does not have any common defence policy.</seg>
<seg>. (NL) Without weapons, the world would be much surer.</seg>
<seg>The resolution does not want to radically reduce the sales of weapons to support a policy of disarmament, but only to control them in order to guarantee always more the profits of industry groups.</seg>
<seg>The Commission communication recognizes the problem but does not propose concrete measures, because it is locked up in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and the proposals which it can make do not touch at the bottom of a cruel reality - in particular for the children -, that of the whole licence which the multinationals enjoy, which, in their hunting for the profit, are not concerned at all about the impacts with their programs and their products and transfer the whole responsibility to the parents, by inviting them even to consume new products to protect their children.</seg>
<seg>Following the example rapporteur, I think that measurements aiming at protecting the young people against the programs violent one and vermin should not be limited on television traditional, but to apply to the whole of the media.</seg>
<seg>With a three hours average per day, it is the most important human activity after the sleep and, for the adults, work.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the women often occupy of the “flexible” stations; the temporary contracts or the low wages are typical sectors occupying mainly of the women.</seg>
<seg>With being first victims of the compression of the public spending, privatizations in the sector of health - for the right of access with the care and the treatments, without speaking about the right to the prevention programs and of information.</seg>
<seg>B5-0792/2000, Misters Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli, in the name of the confederal group of the European unified left/Nordic Green Left, on the crisis situation in Peru.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would have wished that a debate on the Latin America not be done solely according to one or the other topical problems, but rather within the framework of a discussion prepared well in the commissions.</seg>
<seg>We must make so that Peru achieves the goal which it laid down with candidates who are with the height of the challenge and who capable of exaucer are seen of Peruvian people, namely a political renewal and a substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>However, we know that Afghanistan is not far, that Afghanistan is the largest world producer of opiated, and thus we know and we can imagine the role that these political Maffias, not only political besides, play in the expansion of the drug trade.</seg>
<seg>It call on the Commission to give a description of the programmes of humanitarian aid in direction of the Afghan populations, so that no one is not forgotten on the territory.</seg>
<seg>The sufferings related to this conflict are terrible.</seg>
<seg>A budget line finances clearance programmes and of prevention since years.</seg>
<seg>Allow me to answer the warnings of Mrs. Paciotti by saying that I of course will question the Commission to today know what it is occurred and what must occur of the means devoted to the mine clearance.</seg>
<seg>B5-0794/2000, Misters Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Fava, in the name of the Europeans Group of the European Socialist, on removal in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in the negotiations with the guerrilla;</seg>
<seg>We would wish all not to have to speak again of Colombia.</seg>
<seg>The Commission already proposed to coordinate measurements of such a package. The Commission already envisages in the next days to release from the considerable funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, once again, two weights, two measurements, and I believe that it should be deplored.</seg>
<seg>This attitude of the Albanian opposition party consisting in knowingly rejecting a necessary solution to regulate an Albanian problem in Macedonia east in my eyes completely incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg>I think that the Macedonians carried out an extraordinary performance while managing to settle between them the questions of an interior nature.</seg>
<seg>This is why I also think that this reconciliation can hold. However, the government, which very courageously found a solution with the question of the universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of the success as well as strong support, under penalty of seeing the peace threatened as a whole of the area.</seg>
<seg>The funds HEADLIGHT placed at the disposal for the year 2000 within the framework it national plan can also be used as assistance at the university at the time of the next academic year 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg>I make a point of pointing out that we all today, eurodéputés Greek, we from now on reacted vis-a-vis this situation.</seg>
<seg>And all that, which relates to Greece, which occupies the first rank in the European Union for the sector of the merchant navy, relates to in fact safety at sea under all its aspects in the Union.</seg>
<seg>During last years, much of other people perished at sea, not only following shipwrecks of ferry boats, but, in a way well too regular, within our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, the innocent victims are used to promote vaster objectives of the ship-owners.</seg>
<seg>We must return account well to us that it also goes there from the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>To conclude, I would wish to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the European security issue of legislation of the ships intended for passenger transport must be seen giving the highest priority within the European Union and that what imports, it is to make sure that these legal tendencies are applied as a whole of the Community in a strict and uniform way.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mesdames and the Deputies, forgive me to be arrived a little late for reasons which you know well, in order to make a brief statement on the two subjects which are with the order of business: the situation in Belgrade and in the ex-Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Misters the Verheugen police chief will express himself, like made Misters Solana, on the two topics which join together us this afternoon, i.e. the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg>We must be ready to hold this promise, as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mister the High representative, Mister the Police chief, it is with reserve that I take part in this debate, because I did not wish that our Parliament seems only one judge authorized to throw the anathema on such or such, at the time when, after the hopes so much extremely raised here even one month ago, we are confronted with the dramatic consequences of this new outbreak of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, my intervention of today rests not only on various analyses of situation, but also on the experiments which I lived personally last week, since I was incidentally in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when the disorders burst.</seg>
<seg>Even if one is opposed to any violence, it is not possible to put on the same foot Israeli violence and Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg>I would like to ask the Parliament, in this critical moment, to make a statement of support intended for the courageous people who have, today, defended freedom in the streets of Belgrade, thus reiterating the support which we brought, we, Européens, it does not have there so a long time, with those which also fought for their freedom in other capitals.</seg>
<seg>Europeans, Madam the President, undoubtedly would be well inspired to seize with the jump the ball which was launched to us here even by the president of the Palestinian Legislative council.</seg>
<seg>The statute of Jerusalem constitutes a thorny point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>During years, thanks to its apparatus of propaganda and with the brutal pressure that he exerted on the media, he succeeded in misleading the inhabitants of his country, but alas also a great number of people in the Western mode, to present a false image of reality to them.</seg>
<seg>Whereas this drama touches at its end, this Parliament has to have, as a symbol of free and linked Europe, to support crowd outside the Yugoslav Parliament and to help Misters Kosturica to fill his mandate.</seg>
<seg>It is precisely this hard attitude as the stone which makes us fear the worst - and the topicality illustrates the words that I consigned a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg>I wonder whether the police chief envisages already stages which will make it possible to show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of Serbian people and as the partner with whom the European Union will have henceforth to treat.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament makes a point of expressing its total solidarity in this historic moment to him when tyranny is wavering and where triumph the democracy.</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls the report/ratio (A5-0237/2000) Misters Seppänen, in the name of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council modifying the decision 2000/24/CE in order to extend the guarantee granted by the Community to the European Investment Bank to the loans in favour of projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to greet the new political direction which opened in this country after the parliamentary elections and presidential.</seg>
<seg>Between the Union and Croatia, there exists in particular an advisory working party which aims to place at the disposal of Croatia its competence and its technical assistance in the negotiations of the agreements governing the mutual reports/ratios.</seg>
<seg>Let us not forget that Croatia recently symbolized still the failure of a privatisation programme from which only some benefitted.</seg>
<seg>The contribution of which we discuss, in the form of a loan of 250 Million euros of the EIB over the period 2000-2007 cannot consequently be a stake but must be a stimulative help.</seg>
<seg>It is thus not completely exact to speak about democratization in this report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>When, one half-century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became independent for the first time, they were satellite countries of the mode hitlérien.</seg>
<seg>We can obviously dissociate the question of the guarantees and that of Croatia, neither of the discussion of yesterday evening, nor of the developments which took place in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg>At one moment when it appears that Milosevic fled and that the will of Serbian people prevailed, we hope that the establishment of normal relations and the partnership between Serbia and our Union of democracies will be for soon.</seg>
<seg>I declare taken again the session of the European Parliament, which had been stopped on Friday October 6, 2000.</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament, upright, observes one minute of silence)</seg>
<seg>My question is the following one: who speaks in the name of the European Parliament relating to this Statute?</seg>
<seg>I ask you, Madam the President, to do all that is in your capacity in order to accelerate the current proceeding in Committee on Petitions concerning a document presented by more than thirty social groups and ONG in order to protest against this situation of flagrant violation of the Community regulation on protection against radiation.</seg>
<seg>The autopsy carried out in Georgia showed that it is clearly about an assassination after probable tortures.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, honourable Members, we on the occasion to take a great step towards your dream - which is not, moreover, mine.</seg>
<seg>It is the fundamental regulation, of the base of all the other regulations on the genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg>It puts obviously the feet in the dish, one after the other.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting, adjourned with 17:40, is taken again with 17:50)</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls the report/ratio (A5-0291/2000) of Mrs. Van Lancker, in the name of the commission of employment and the social affairs on the Commission communication with the Council [COM (2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219 (COS)], in the European Parliament, at the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.</seg>
<seg>The fact of stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method must also replace the social legislation, because we must fix, in Europe, of the social rights, we must dare to define social minimums and to work out a social legislation which is essential within the framework of an European internal market.</seg>
<seg>In our opinion, we support also the dialogue and the Cooperation with civil society, and mainly with the organizations of women of the countries which prepare their integration in the European family, because it is necessary for us to ensure it in time a uniform development which will follow the stages and the motivations of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg>The areas of action enumerated in the Commission communication also were the subject of an general agreement.</seg>
<seg>I recall, at this stage of my intervention, the behaviour of a European seminar in Biarritz on this subject on December 4, seminar which I will chair.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the fight against exclusions, we achieved a great progress while defining, last on October 17, with the Council “Employment and social policy”, of the suitable objectives of fight against the poverty and the social exclusion which will be used as a basis for national action plans.</seg>
<seg>I heard certain people having read the report/ratio to say that they are of agreement with the diagnosis but not with the remedy suggested.</seg>
<seg>Technological development and the new methods of organisation also legitimate a flexible cooperation, more stressing the objectives and obtaining results and attaching less importance to rigid regulations.</seg>
<seg>It is on this side that it is advisable to seek, in our opinion, the archaism reproached those which do not await Brave New World of a market without obstacle.</seg>
<seg>This contributed certainly to reduce the social unrest in our country and to support the investment programmes of foreign assets.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the method used seems more debatable.</seg>
<seg>If we speak about a charter of the rights and if we favorably see the development of a European constitution, we cannot be reached of strabism, and we must say that it is necessary to take all the steps necessary in this direction, even if that asks for a more detailed legislation.</seg>
<seg>I would like to point out, in a critical way, the lack of initiatives on the new requirements related on safety at work, the consultation of the workers and the labor relations.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would like me to also congratulate the rapporteur, the police chief and the minister, Mrs. Péry, for this presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg>These points, let us know we it, are fought by the conservatives in Europe. We, with our group, are particularly attached there.</seg>
<seg>The third question of the contents is widening.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place Wednesday with 12:30.</seg>
<seg>It would be necessary to supplement the Commission measures by a revision of the possibilities of individual access to the health care, with the social security and the pension system, gaps of the organisation of work, and perhaps also by a generalized reduction of the working time.</seg>
<seg>Thus, the women will feel Europe close to them, and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will shape thanks to the relationship with this program.</seg>
<seg>We thus await an annual report of the president of the Commission in the context of an annual declaration in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>I delighted moreover that one plans a better installation of the child care in order to facilitate balance between working life and family life.</seg>
<seg>My group will hold account in its final vote of it.</seg>
<seg>(The President withdraws the word with the speaker)</seg>
<seg>I find the fresh approach of the very positive Commission, and the draft decision for the program 2001-2005, very considered.</seg>
<seg>I think that the considerable number of amendments which is accepted testifies to the community of spirit which exists between the Commission and the Committee on Women.</seg>
<seg>Initially, because I received, during the past year, of numerous requests on behalf of companies, which feel a little impotent compared to the decisions of fusion that they must take, in particular whenever they owed interjeter appeal against the decision of the Commission in front of the county court.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to ask the Monti police chief which date one will be able to hope for the publication of a register efficient public and valid on the State aid as well as the table, awaited so much, of the results.</seg>
<seg>I would like to also announce to the Monti police chief who it is important that, in the forthcoming report, a more important section is devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg>What I have just said is not valid only for the field of energy, but for the other fields in general.</seg>
<seg>Mister the Monti Police chief, in the name of the Italian radicals, I would like to thank to me also the rapporteurs for the excellent work completed in the two reports/ratios, which put forth a flattering judgement on your work and that of the head office of competition.</seg>
<seg>I insist on this point because the market cannot regulate all and that, accordingly, it does not have there nor cannot have there of competition without limits.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, today, nobody calls in question, and I will not make it, the fact that the State aid deteriorates the conditions of competition and constitutes a harmful element which does not encourage the companies to be more powerful.</seg>
<seg>To intend thus to deny the fact that the State aid decreased during the period 1994-1998, whereas the Commission recognizes itself this reduction, was already at the very least curious.</seg>
<seg>Today, we cannot obviously, Mr. President, to be unaware of the past, although my opinion refers to XXIXe Commission Report on the competition policy, and must learn the lessons for the future from them.</seg>
<seg>During the speaking time of which I lay out, I would like to approach, Mr. President, the three following points: the modernization of the Community law of competition, the activity achieved in 1999 in the application of the competition rule and the topic of the State aid.</seg>
<seg>The Commission continued to intervene with firmness in particular compared to the trusts and with the abuses of dominant positions, just like in the field of the concentrations.</seg>
<seg>Misters Rapkay, it was extremely important, for the Commission, to have the support of the European Parliament for the continuation of its competition policy and I do not have the impression that this support can weaken.</seg>
<seg>This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or under article 119 of the treaty establishing the European Community, provision which remains in force lasting the third phase of the economic and monetary union for the States which make the object of an exemption, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg>The recourse to the capital market should remain the only possible option in the future.</seg>
<seg>I thus express the wish that this report/ratio receives the approval of this Parliament in her version present and that the interior market thus also applies to the sector of the vine.</seg>
<seg>Today, its revision is necessary taking into account the evolutions of the plant health regulation and the scientific progresses and techniques, occurred in particular in in vitro multiplication.</seg>
<seg>I estimate moreover that the reference, through this precautionary principle, with the possibility of the genetic modifications means, for example, the reduction of the intensive use of plant health treatments.</seg>
<seg>To conclude, my honourable Members, to respect the precautionary principle, in its spirit as in its letter, so by misfortune the articles and amendments which I have just quoted were not withdrawn, it would be necessary, as claim it the wine growers, that we follow the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, therefore of the Committee on the Environment, and vote their suppression.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, if you allow: Mister the Police chief, can you deliver your opinion on the Environment Committee amendment, of the public health and the consumer policy? It is amendment 1.</seg>
<seg>The only point on which one could discuss, it is that to know if I should or not have taken note as soon as the French government addressed to me the decree of forfeiture of mandate of Misters Le Pen.</seg>
<seg>I remind to you that the vote takes place with 12:30 presently.</seg>
<seg>In the field of justice and interior matters, I am optimistic on a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg>The preparatory group will play fully its part until November 19, date of the forthcoming meeting at the ministerial level.</seg>
<seg>We needed this invigorating climate, like said it Misters Moscovici, and I have me also felt, on the level of the heads of state and government, a very serious feeling of collective responsibility and historical at one historic moment in the construction European.</seg>
<seg>It will be necessary simply, Mesdames and the Deputies, to take care from now, in these subjects of the qualified majority, not to find us in-on this side spirit or climate of Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>More the tiny countries of the European Union are not the subordinates of largest!</seg>
<seg>I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the presence of president Kostunica is an historic event.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mr. President of the Council, Mister the Police chief, so of progress took place on the reinforced cooperations and the extension of the qualified majority, of the deep disagreements remain on the composition of the Commission, weighting of votes in Council, you underlined it.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that one goes in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg>Those which refuse the reinforced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement as the passengers of the back seat of a car.</seg>
<seg>I am not there, more than you, to introduce me into the German interior matters, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and goes besides in the direction of what the Commission wishes, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg>We started to have exchanges on this question, from where it arises that all the Member States wish the maintenance of this ceiling after widening.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it will not be the case.</seg>
<seg>The first: one sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and major Members.</seg>
<seg>From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg>Even when the candidate countries reach the Union, each Member State must be able to preserve a police chief “junior” or “senior”.</seg>
<seg>The wording of the text of article 93 is all the more dramatic as once the first wave of widening succeeded, we will be even more in impossibility of advancing towards the qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>They are indeed to convince the citizens of these countries the obvious merits of very new European treaty.</seg>
<seg>That would have been to ignore the springs of such a crisis to imagine that the fears maintained during generations could make place without new sudden starts with the final appeasing, is a prelude to with the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg>I also worry about the answer weakened at the request of the Parliament for a democratization.</seg>
<seg>However, the fault returns from there rather to those which wish to utilize reforms of extensive scales before widening.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the decision of the chief of the Israeli government to freeze the peace negotiations because of the violence which reigns in the area and to center its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the opposition leader, Misters Sharon.</seg>
<seg>It is with an immense satisfaction of course that we learned the victory gained by the Yugoslav population and the election from its president Mm. Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>I advise with Misters Barón Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain to him why they are with the government in Italy with a party which is declared communist openly and prepare to face the parliamentary elections with another party openly communist, the partito per the rifondazione comunista.</seg>
<seg>Progress takes a lead in this plan in the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is better capable to provide the necessary impetuses in the future by the possibility than it has to vote in the majority simple.</seg>
<seg>The European Union does not need today visionaries who look until 2030, but people who can determine the problems which will bring widening in the three to eight years to come, and which can find the solutions with these problems.</seg>
<seg>It is thus about an open work which did not fall from in top and which was not imposed.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>For lack of this fundamental reference mark, at best one is not included/understood any more, in the worst case one maintained.</seg>
<seg>The democracy goes better to Europe, but the European democracy, it, is sick.</seg>
<seg>Today, October 24, 2000, to Strasbourg, the European Parliament says a simple thing and strongly says it: the European Constitution, yes, you can it, yes, we want it.</seg>
<seg>This one thus expresses the idea that insularity is in itself a sufficient criterion.</seg>
<seg>I will go to essence by concentrating me on the projecting points of the Gil-Robles report of the President, of which I will say quite simply that I find it excellent.</seg>
<seg>Initially, that of a simplification and a clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg>I will not go further, because we are not there - in any case I am not there - to discuss the report/ratio of the Institute of Florence.</seg>
<seg>According to information - I will be technical, forgive-the-me - which was communicated to the presidency, it seems that a clear majority of the linguistic versions, contrary to the Italian version, does not refer, for the application of the cohesion policy, that in the least supported islands and not in the islands in general.</seg>
<seg>Mr Duhamel, you will undoubtedly be of agreement with me to say that if there is no success in Nice, it will not have there a place, at least not credibility, for a discussion on the future of European integration, in any case in the current framework.</seg>
<seg>It is as essential as in this European constitution the distribution of the missions between the Member States and the European Union is clearly defined. The dynamics of European integration should be included there to cover the fields in which it is imperatively necessary to act jointly, such as for example foreign policy safety.</seg>
<seg>They could also prove necessary to overcome persistent blockings.</seg>
<seg>We need more than clearness in the division of competences and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>Each one knows that there exist extremely different designs on this subject in the various Member States and within the various social groups.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly opposite and obviously we cannot approve it.</seg>
<seg>In the reinforced European home, indeed, there will be people sitting with the military, monetary, possibly tax table and then the other people which will be at side.</seg>
<seg>There is obvious that the second version is not the good one and that, firstly, because the economically delayed areas are in any event covered by the Structural Funds and that, secondly, if this interpretation were valid, it would not have been no reason to adopt the declaration No 30</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I will center my poor small sixty seconds on the report/ratio of Olivier Duhamel, who is an excellent report, because he dares to say the things clearly, and the lyricism of our rapporteur definitively presently convinced us.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, the unit of Europe can be only political.</seg>
<seg>It seems to us that the new Constitution should already be ready to come into effect for the forthcoming European elections.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the qualifier “less developed” applies as well to the island regions as with the other areas and, if one follows the proposal of Misters Barnier, it is advisable here to modify the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the convention of Vienna.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>Since the colleague said that she would vote against, the amendment is thus rejected.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the modification which is required here would carry out us straight to chaos.</seg>
<seg>- (IN) I am pleased with the adoption of the Trakatellis report/ratio by this Parliament because it envisages the fixing of quality standards and safety raised for the blood and the blood derivatives.</seg>
<seg>If European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should have seized us lifting of that of Misters Le Pen.</seg>
<seg>. I am particularly disappointed vote of the EP on the report/ratio on the multiplication of the young vines.</seg>
<seg>The ones consider that alcohol, just like the tobacco and drugs, are a product likely to cause much wrong to those which consume some and their entourage. The others just like consider it on the contrary before a source of employment and important enrichment.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur reserves as a whole positive reception with the proposals of the white paper of the Commission relative on this subject, but it however has fears as for the possible implications of the reform, of which the main aim and to decentralize the application of the competition rule.</seg>
<seg>. In the debate of yesterday evening, if I could greet Jonathan Evans for his work, I had to say of entry my deep disagreement with the too liberal, if not ultra impregnation liberal, of his report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>AID Ireland centred its activity in order to attract in the area of objective 1 half of all employment of Greenfield Projects in the three years to come.</seg>
<seg>Vis-a-vis the outcry that the consequences of this policy cause, the interventions, financings and other economic and tax incentives of the State come to compensate for the situation partly.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting, stopped with 14:06, is taken again at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>And we are thus, in October 2000, with the day before to make a decision as for the figuring of the budget 2001.</seg>
<seg>That however did not prevent the Council from reducing the agricultural expenditure of a total of 555 million euros.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, we obviously estimate that it is not enough simply, quite simply, to create 400 additional positions.</seg>
<seg>I can only invite the Council to follow us.</seg>
<seg>This is why the administration of this Parliament is there for the deputies and not the opposite.</seg>
<seg>At present, it is the Court of Auditors which causes us less concern.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, we must treat budget of the Mediator.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, we are of opinion that this field should be reinforced have regard to the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>We propose moreover that the Parliament continues to be regularly informed.</seg>
<seg>When one organizes a legislative dialogue on social affairs, cultural or environmental - the police chief will recognize that I am right - we meet with the Commissioner for Budgets, the Ministers for Finance and the members of the Committee on Budgets in order to request together so that no financial error is made.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mesdames and the Members of Parliament, Madam the Police chief, Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your reception.</seg>
<seg>The Council voted as of the single reading the appropriations which seem to him justified for 2001, without holding tactical account of the concerns of order which serves the objective of good allocation of appropriations that the Community institutions must continue.</seg>
<seg>Before you do not come to a conclusion about the draft budget 2001, I would wish to insist on a certain number of objectives which the Council and the Parliament have in common and which can result in an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>We are in a similar situation as regards structural policy.</seg>
<seg>Misters Naval Colom I announced it, the dialogue of this summer it also brought a good performance: in the future, the Parliament will have better information as regards legal bases which affect the plan of the expenditure.</seg>
<seg>I allow myself to recall that the financial perspective envisaged last year for Balkans did not expect that 1,85 billion euros for the whole of the period running up to 2006.</seg>
<seg>I once again ask you to examine without prejudice this proposal which the Commission maintains and to keep in mind this possibility.</seg>
<seg>This material obviously was useful at the same time for the preparation of the budget 2001 and the discharge of 1999.</seg>
<seg>Even if I appreciate much the work of this body as a member of the Committee on Budgets, even if I estimate as much the work of the rapporteurs for the Committee of the budgets, I do not want to miss, as an economic and monetary rapporteur for the Committee, to announce two proposed amendments which this commission submits once again to plenary and whose importance is not negligible, in spite of the modesty of the amounts concerned.</seg>
<seg>By these measurements, we want to make control legal again fully operational, to restore confidence in the legal certainty within the EU and to consolidate the community of right which is the European Union.</seg>
<seg>By considering the suppression of this initiative without envisaging the lesser degree of replacement, the Commission made fi clearly political desire expressed in Lisbon and priority stated by this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>This decision was at the very least astonishing and it gave the impression to number among us that the whole of this program, very important, had simply become a goldbeater's skin that the Committee on Budgets and the European commission return themselves.</seg>
<seg>The third point relates to the common agricultural policy such as it is defined in the draft budgets.</seg>
<seg>If employment is the priority Union policy, fishing, as an economic sector, cannot remain in margin.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased in particular that the funding of programmes Socrates, Jeunesse and Culture 2000, whose continuation was decided with the last end of the year, could be assured.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the assistance in the Mediterranean countries, for example, the arrear relates to the budgets of several years.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, at the time of the debates of the last years, I spoke in the name of the commission of the culture, youth, education, the media and the sports, for which we heard this afternoon Mrs. Iivari.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless I would wish to say to the Parliament this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the largest part of this money is managed in the Member States.</seg>
<seg>I come now to the general strategy.</seg>
<seg>This brings me to the strategy of my group, because at the base our conviction is the wish to give some the European citizen for his money.</seg>
<seg>We must on the contrary do everything so that this Parliament is an example of transparency, effectiveness, and good democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary for us to think of the manner of solving this problem.</seg>
<seg>We want to support the processes of democratisation and we want to arrive to a balance between the traditional fields of the foreign policy which we must treat.</seg>
<seg>The most difficult problems in the new budget relate to the external actions.</seg>
<seg>It goes without saying a sparing management is necessary, it has our support and us do not should delude us on this point.</seg>
<seg>It is a very exceptional initiative, especially in single reading, and it is an ungrateful initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, to collect a majority of votes favorable.</seg>
<seg>That being, the importance of the equipment for Kosovo is not without posing some problems.</seg>
<seg>The budgetary policy must inspire confidence at the citizen towards the European policy.</seg>
<seg>All measurements thus should be supported aiming at reinforcing the small and medium-size companies.</seg>
<seg>budgetary implementation rate;</seg>
<seg>By keeping this strategic approach in the approach of the budgets of this year and the years to come, the European Parliament fully occupies its place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, with the transfer of 175 million euros, we made an estimate of 25 million more than what was envisaged.</seg>
<seg>With regard to program MEDA, the Council declared that the commitments entered into do not pose any problem being given the eight years of payment arrears.</seg>
<seg>I believe that Misters Duff was present this morning, when we evoked the European Council of Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>My answer will be very simple.</seg>
<seg>Ramiro Zapata was the last of the 25 defenders of the human rights to be assassinated and recently the Colombian press denounced “Plan 100” of the paramilitary groups aiming at assassinating hundred defenders of the human rights.</seg>
<seg>The attitude of the Council delights me a little today than in July because, like often at the time of crisis situations, the European Union seems to be the last to be appeared on the international scene and to make there hear its voice.</seg>
<seg>The question, Mr. President, and I finish, is to know if there is not a means of pressure stronger than that proposed by the president in his information and if the aid which we will grant is completely different from that of the United States, i.e., directed not towards the fumigation of the cultures, but towards their substitution, and as towards the social aspects rather as military.</seg>
<seg>The questions which several deputies and myself put touch specifically with the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg>Their objects being connected, I call simultaneously the questions nº 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 and 13.</seg>
<seg>Subject: Taxation on the financial transactions the speculative claim of a taxation of capital does not cease gaining ground these last months, with the multiplication of the committees ATTAC (Association for a Taxation on the Financial transactions and the Assistance with the Citizens) in France and Europe, and the tabled amendments with the French National Assembly like with the Senate.</seg>
<seg>I would also like that one answers the question of his influence about the volatility of the markets of currencies, and in particular of the effect of a tax of 0,1 per thousand on the speculators who await devaluations of about 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg>She in addition asks paragraph 26 the installation of an international organisation of arbitration to erase the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg>They is besides what occurred for the euro on a scale one year, that is to regret it or wish it.</seg>
<seg>I will add so that Danielle Auroi said, presently, compared to the countries of the South, that certain estimates, made by specialists, give interesting figures: for example, a fork going from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be recovered of a tax on Tobin type, whereas, in same time, the UNDP, quantifies with an amount of 40 billion dollars per annum, assembling it which could be enough to give minimal living conditions to the hundreds of million people who miss of all in the countries of the developing world.</seg>
<seg>These last months, of the cases were discovered, in particular, in various places of France.</seg>
<seg>I thus put the question, since a representative of the French presidency is here, to know if the demolition of these cows will be paid on the community budget or if you pay it on the national budget and if you estimate that it would be a good thing that one pays it on the community budget.</seg>
<seg>Can I request your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer?</seg>
<seg>Thus the action of the two governments concerned is limited by this international law.</seg>
<seg>I do not include/understand how the Commission can already say in that February which it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg>While acting of the kind in the name of subsidiarity, the Union misses, actually, with the one of its duties, as that occurred, these last weeks, as well in the north of Italy as in Spain.</seg>
<seg>As a concerned deputy of this majority, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11,5 billion poured by the British taxpayers - it is our current annual contribution - if it does not profit from an broad agreement of the public?</seg>
<seg>A flexible attitude of the Council would make it possible to be able at an agreement in second reading in order to buckle the budget.</seg>
<seg>If somebody needs to be convinced about it, that it notes of it simply the proof.</seg>
<seg>This strategy was already introduced by Joan Colom I Naval, vice-president in load of the buildings.</seg>
<seg>The political messages present in the budget of this exercise - and the Schreyer police chief spoke about it - are numerous: the agricultural adaptation of the common, of new structural programmes, a better implementation of policies structural, the follow-up of the decisions taken at the Summit of Lisbon for the creation of a stronger and more competing European Union and fight against social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>The war carried out by NATO too much destroyed and left behind it of too great sufferings.</seg>
<seg>In spite of what was agreed, I wonder sometimes if it is possible to arrive to this objective within the existing budgetary limits without attacking the agricultural budget necessary to a durable rural sector in the current Member States.</seg>
<seg>And I say it very clearly to you: it is necessary to give its chance to Kostunica and I hope since it will take care of an amnesty during the weeks or of the months to come; but meanwhile, I wish however that, on the political plan and the budgetary term, of the political conditions be coupled with the introduction of these two special budget headings, namely democratization and the rebuilding.</seg>
<seg>The elections which proceeded in Yugoslavia showed two things: people finally had of it enough the dictator Milosevic and they granted their confidence to professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>I am certain that the prisoners Albanian politicians will be also released soon.</seg>
<seg>Failing this, we would inevitably fall in “financial engineering”, the redistributions and the cuts, as well into the social expenditure and environmental as in the co-operation, without being sure in so far as the sums intended for Balkans are sufficient.</seg>
<seg>In the context which occupies us, it is a question of solving major social problems such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg>There is, of course, a very important point, it is the fact that we started the heading four, with its approach, but we do not know yet very well if we managed to solve the problem, in particular because the Council does not wish to take part sufficiently in the reflexion.</seg>
<seg>The priorities are an essential element of any budgetary work.</seg>
<seg>That does not carry to consequence the day before the expiry of the Treaty but that would become alarming if legal framework post-ECSC allowed to maintain such practices.</seg>
<seg>This brings me to a third remark on the task which is now in front of us.</seg>
<seg>Mistrust with regard to the political leaders of the EU continues to grow, as I could see me.</seg>
<seg>I pay homage for that to them.</seg>
<seg>The provision with the discussion of all the institutions concerned allowed an exemplary collaboration thanks to which, we will be able - I hope it sincerely - to manage an agreement in single reading.</seg>
<seg>We who are engaged in favour of the European values in a country Eurosceptic, we will have from now on an additional argument for the EU, namely a more effective protection of the people, which is important for the citizens within the modern society.</seg>
<seg>I noted that my own country was on the point of proceeding to an amendment of Law on the data with personal nature, which, in the current state, deprives the elected officials of any influence on the Commission decisions.</seg>
<seg>Many other points also problems pose and deserve the judgement of the practice to be assured.</seg>
<seg>The Commission would like initially to point out the engagement which we took all towards the citizens to guarantee protection of personal data treated by the institutions.</seg>
<seg>By this declaration, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation is limited to the activities of the first pillar exclusively.</seg>
<seg>In order to honour the political agreement that she concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to allow approval in single reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment which would not form part of the Paciotti report/ratio approved by the parliamentary committee of freedoms and the rights of citizens, except the amendment 69 which corrects amendment 41.</seg>
<seg>Thus, it is urgent that manpower of the Interdepartmental Group are very quickly reinforced with the cur of the General Secretariat of the Commission, so that all the proposals of act of general scope can be accompanied, during their examination by the college on basis of Article 299, paragraph 2, of a detailed impact statement.</seg>
<seg>The Legal Committee and of the interior market estimates that it is important to stress that one can compare only what is comparable.</seg>
<seg>Being given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this observation.</seg>
<seg>Since the creation of an Interdepartmental Group for the outermost regions with in the chair Misters Delors, a length and profitable way were traversed up to now and I make a point of addressing the most sincere thanks of Europeans of the ultraperiphery to that which chaired this group.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, so as of the Treaty of Rome, it was refers to the French overseas departments, it was necessary to wait until 1989 and the programs of specific options related on the distance and insularity, the famous POSEI, so that the European Union admits finally that the permanence and the combination of the handicaps structural of the outermost regions justified a special treatment compared to the other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg>I do not doubt only the proposals that the Commission will formulate with the Council will carry the mark of these qualities.</seg>
<seg>This question is all the more relevant as we approach one enlargement of the Union in the East.</seg>
<seg>This right to the difference is not anything else, which more is, that an emanation of the principle of equality, which also requires to treat in a different way what is different.</seg>
<seg>It is a document which we consider, my team and me, like rich person in ideas, in proposals, which goes to the cur of the problems and which does not dodge any the areas of concern of the Community ultraperiphery.</seg>
<seg>Your report/ratio, Mrs Sudre, stress, rightly, on the need for acting in the duration.</seg>
<seg>As for the revival of the diversification of the economy, we have advanced in several essential areas.</seg>
<seg>It is essential now that a great number of projects is presented within the framework of DOCUPs, but, parallel to this action on the ground, we must think thoroughly of the needs, with the accesses, specific of each one of these outermost regions to this information society.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the official report of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg>I will of course announce your intervention to the president.</seg>
<seg>I am concerned with risk of a general failure of a great number of machines and rules which would then question the decisions of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>This food authority and the legislative proposals which are presented to us, aiming at guaranteeing food safety, will profit from the support from this Parliament, Mister the Police chief.</seg>
<seg>The main task of this Authority will be a task of scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must be “pure too” him.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and his opening to the opinions for the other commissions.</seg>
<seg>When we are confronted with a potential risk, it is important to put the precautionary principle into practice.</seg>
<seg>On the question always discussed to know up to what point we must allow him to consider the nutrition, to really give councils and to be consulted by those which are worried primarily risk management, we also said that, when it is about safety, these questions should at least fall under the mission of consultation of this food Safety authority.</seg>
<seg>An central element of this last point consists in making so that the rich heritage of traditions which is ours can perdurer.</seg>
<seg>The elements which will make it possible this respectability to be born call neither laws nor legislation, but well integrity, irreproachable academic quality, independence, obligation to return account, transparency and intelligibility.</seg>
<seg>A good scientific knowledge is certainly essential for better evaluating the risks relateds with the chain of the food, of the farm to table.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the passion for the introduction of an European agency of food safety, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it, is obviously considerable.</seg>
<seg>As long as the program of WHO remains correctly financed and constant, it seems not to be necessary to create an organization moreover, especially not an agency whose range is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; indeed, the latter want to be able to be nourished healthily and it is with us to take care of it.</seg>
<seg>If we do not work out any new framework directive, we will be able to only smile in connection with many things in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg>We must consequently modify the Treaty on the European Union so that the Commission has the possibility of applying sanctions in the field of feedingstuffs, exactly as it can do it today as regards competition.</seg>
<seg>I support all the participating actors, who they are political, administrative or different, which work within the framework of the strategy “Food for all”.</seg>
<seg>I am not agreement with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body.</seg>
<seg>It must be the true brain of coordination of the network of the national agencies which, in their turn, will have to activate and coordinate a network of centers of excellence of food safety at the regional level.</seg>
<seg>Also, I am of opinion that your amendment 11 and my amendment 17 are perfectly reconcilable.</seg>
<seg>The reform of the food law of the European Union must be done with the Union level.</seg>
<seg>His report/ratio does not propose as well the changes as it does not stress a certain number of elements.</seg>
<seg>We clearly said it in the report/ratio, and I am pleased some without reserve.</seg>
<seg>However, the creation of an European agency on food safety is very positive.</seg>
<seg>It is to be hoped that, in the interest of the European consumers, they will be respected.</seg>
<seg>It is essential, I think, to define precise deadlines in which it will be advisable to notify at the European commission any case causing a justified concern.</seg>
<seg>The EU must have the most raised standards food safety for her citizens.</seg>
<seg>The Commission now proposes the creation of an authority European Food Safety.</seg>
<seg>I fear that Europe again does not expose itself to the risk to obtain an enormous administrative machinery, incompetent to act.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the output is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of the committed expenditure.</seg>
<seg>Prevent double and parallel work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg>It should however be prevented that, in the shade of the debate on the White Paper, in the public opinion the fear of bureaucratic Europe is not reinforced which influences product quality without curing in an effective way the frauds which threaten the consumer health.</seg>
<seg>As you know it, the Commission attaches more the utmost importance to its strategy as regards food safety.</seg>
<seg>The Commission envisages to adopt a draft regulation founding the principles and the objectives which will form the keystone of the food law and will constitute the framework of the future health protection measures as regards food.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mister the Police chief.</seg>
<seg>To come to my report/ratio, I consider positive the Commission proposal and must add that the foreign affairs committees and of the development worked much to improve it, in particular on certain points.</seg>
<seg>As Mrs. Bonino clearly said it, one took a step ahead by the draft regulation of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>The draft regulation of the Commission seems to us extremely vague.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to organize the equipment of mining operations correctly and to finance research for work of detection and mine clearance and for the instruments which can be used simply on the spot in order to come in aid to developing countries.</seg>
<seg>During these eight last years, the European Union devoted more than 200 million euros of the community budget to the fight against the anti-personnel mines.</seg>
<seg>But we cannot penalize the people whose government makes exactions.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, I already spoke about it, I think that it would be an error, on the basis of a fine sentiment certainly, but all the same counterproductive, to make adhesion with the Convention of Ottawa an absolute condition of Community giving aid for the fight against the anti-personnel mines.</seg>
<seg>I cannot accept amendment 19.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, the international community suffers from a lack of coordination of its efforts on a world level and more particularly in the countries hits.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the Socialist Group shares the pride which has just expressed at the moment Misters van Orden about the European Union.</seg>
<seg>You point out the Soviet bomb-toys in Afghanistan!</seg>
<seg>I thank you for quality for your report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the Kampuchean ones call the mines the eternal sentinels.</seg>
<seg>The population maintains a mistrust justified with respect to the forces in uniform, whatever they are, which is explained by long years of war.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I am pleased that there is finally an European legislation, in the form of payment, on the anti-personnel mines and that we have today an excellent report of Mrs. Bonino on this subject.</seg>
<seg>- (OF) Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, very honourable Members, we tackle a very sad question today.</seg>
<seg>It is not a chance if the mines are, initially, in crisis areas, in other words in areas which could take initiatives of another nature to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg>To two kilometers of a hamlet of Bosnia, in 1999, a panel announces the presence of landmines in a field, which does not prevent the presence on the spot of a little boy.</seg>
<seg>It is tragic that it is the civilian population which suffers from the incapacity of its leaders.</seg>
<seg>The day before the 4th Ministerial conference euroméditerranéenne, which will proceed 15 and November 16 next in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for the relations with the Maghreb countries, chaired by Misters Obiols, will make it possible to make progress our project of dialogue and peace.</seg>
<seg>All the mines are stored in deposits.</seg>
<seg>- (OF) Mr. President, since I am of agreement with almost all that my colleagues said previously, it seems useless to me to repeat it. I thus give up using my speaking time.</seg>
<seg>Your open concept of cooperation is to fall down in the institutional diagram dominated by the Commission officials.</seg>
<seg>We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, which wants that the decisions are made at the level nearest possible people concerned.</seg>
<seg>Since, nevertheless, the main proposals of Group amendment EPP have just found a substantial majority, I approved the report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I abstained from, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the outcomes of the European Council abstract of Biarritz, for two reasons: the first because I voted separately, in a nominal way, for paragraphs 2 and 5, which enabled me to express my frank opposition compared to these two paragraphs.</seg>
<seg>In other words, around the table of the common European home, some would eat with the chart and others with the minimum menu.</seg>
<seg>Admittedly, one can always better make, and democratic control should not weaken. But according to us, the enumeration of these rights and their inclusion in the treaties did not constitute the priority issue of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>There were debates about the referendums and of the amendments which were deposited on this subject.</seg>
<seg>At the time of the elections of 1999 in the European Parliament, the electoral participation reached only 40%, if one excludes the countries in which the vote is obligatory, and those in which this European poll was combined with national elections.</seg>
<seg>In order to lead to objective of constitution European - what we wish -, it is necessary to avoid forcing rigid diagrams and methodologies, which would lead fatally to the failure of the desired objective.</seg>
<seg>A social proper constitution should align, by the top, best of the assets for the work world, the women, the immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg>Without denying the creditable intention to reinforce, clarify and look further into the European Union, like simplifying the texts to bring them closer to the citizens, I did not vote for this resolution.</seg>
<seg>the assignment of the capacities and the responsibilities</seg>
<seg>I regard as completely determining the fact that the Charter of Fundamental of the EU involves an adhesion of the Union to European Council Convention on the human rights.</seg>
<seg>But the report/ratio of Misters Gil-Robles comes to my help, because he proposes that for some subjects, sectors and matters, certain Member States of the European Union agree on an united action.</seg>
<seg>The will to allow that a number always crescent of decisions on major areas are taken in the majority qualified is contrary to the basic democratic standards.</seg>
<seg>Today, it tries to prevent the easing of the reinforced cooperations, and it will not finish losing the part, there too.</seg>
<seg>This report/ratio tends to concretize the standpoint in this direction of our Parliament (resolution of April 13, 2000).</seg>
<seg>. (SV) Our opinion in connection with what is called flexible integration is overall positive.</seg>
<seg>. (IN) the British Labor Members of group PSE are pleased with the favourable response reserved for the contribution which they made to the ongoing work of the IGC on the reinforced cooperation, without adhering completely to all the details of this one.</seg>
<seg>These islands must feel integral part of the European Union which, I hope, will make of them a paradise for the tourists and their inhabitants themselves.</seg>
<seg>To the Middle Ages, these areas and their people did not belong to Europe and, even today, they are not truly regarded as European.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the characteristics of these areas, which rise in general from insularity and the distance compared to the continent of Europe, but also of their chronic dependence compared to a limited number of productions or even of only one production, require special measures adapted to the going beyond of these constraints.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I am sorry if I still oblige the presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and would like in particular to express all my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, in what relates to me the Italian Ornella Buson.</seg>
<seg>It appears indeed clearly that the purpose of the agency is to collect the national capacities of defense, or to paralyse them, to put them at the service objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>That does not prevent the Commission and the Parliament to baptize this agency “Authority European”, name which is completely contrary with the philosophy which is supposed to inspire it.</seg>
<seg>It is not completely what proposes to us the Bowis report/ratio, where one has the feeling that food safety is primarily regarded as a new pretext to feed the well-known process of reinforcement of the powers of the Commission to the detriment of the national bodies and public safety.</seg>
<seg>Also, I think of being able, by this declaration, to condemn these unqualifiable acts in the name of our European Parliament which always preached the respect for religious freedom and the tolerance between all the communities.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, I include/understand the reproaches of the rapporteur. However, as a voter the proposed amendments of the rural development and Committee on Agriculture, one does not vote only appropriations but also for or against a given orientation of the policy.</seg>
<seg>Please support the modification of the line A-206, “acquisition of goods real estate”, according to the proposals to amend which will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own ceiling limited to 20% of the whole of the administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote on the motion of modification 929</seg>
<seg>Section VI, Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio (A5-0276/2000) Misters Nicholson, in the name of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council instituting of the additional technical measures aiming at reconstituting the cod stock of Ireland at sea (division CIEM VII a) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament adopts the resolution)</seg>
<seg>Export subsidies cause the flow at low prices, on the worldwide market, of the surpluses of food products, which creates a serious handicap in terms of competition for food industries of many countries, for example developing country.</seg>
<seg>To obtain the necessary financial resources with an increase in the assistance in Balkans, the Member States must carry out a redistribution of the sums available within the framework of the budget.</seg>
<seg>However, the Parliament managed to make adopt a certain number of key priorities - in particular an effort increased in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on series of questions important related on the environment and the etc, equal opportunity We voted against the blows carried by the line with the Life program and the Lobby European Women.</seg>
<seg>- (SV) We maintain our opinion in connection with the travel allowances paid with the European deputies, namely that only the effective expenses incurred at the time of the voyages which enter within the framework of their mission must be to them refunded.</seg>
<seg>I suppose - and I hope that the Commission seeks constructive solutions for this purpose -, that we will have to cover the period ranging between 2002 and 2005 by means of an transitional arrangement.</seg>
<seg>- (OF) In its obsessional will to regulate and liberalize but especially with an aim of muzzling truly the national parliaments, the European commission deposited a draft regulation for an immediate application and obligatory, instead of a proposed directive, which must be treated with the riding crop at the Parliament and the Council to come into effect on December 31 of this year already.</seg>
<seg>We will thus support the efforts made by the Commission in order to reform this sector and we will oppose all new measurements aiming at supporting it.</seg>
<seg>An evolution which made them strongly dependent on the borrowed capital.</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio Nicholson (A-0276/2000)</seg>
<seg>It is important to be able to guarantee that the sums allotted under assistances are not used with military purposes.</seg>
<seg>Our firm opinion is that the reduction of carbon dioxide of carbon and other gases with greenhouse effect will have to be mainly obtained at the cost which truths pollutants (i.e. major industries) will have to pay, with the detriment of their disproportionate profits.</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio Moreira Da Silva (A5-0271/2000)</seg>
<seg>It would be necessary to spend this money, while harmonizing and by coordinating the expenditure for the research policy in all fifteen state of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Was this only by precaution, we are right to want to learn some more on these substances.</seg>
<seg>Voting time is finished.</seg>
<seg>This European format would replace the national format which is already used everywhere at present.</seg>
<seg>The loss of data being used to draw up the statistics of the balance of payments which would result from this modification would be tiny.</seg>
<seg>It should well be returned account to you that in fact mainly the small and medium-size companies are concerned with this problem.</seg>
<seg>Since years already, we claim with insistence a harmonization of the efforts made in this direction.</seg>
<seg>I believe that this report/ratio revêt an crucial importance for a true integration of the citizens and citizens, small and medium-size companies in the euro area and to increase the acceptance of the economic and monetary union.</seg>
<seg>The free movement of the capital in single currency cannot put up to obstacles or important disparities.</seg>
<seg>However, the European Parliament and the Commission attach to it really much importance.</seg>
<seg>I support the double policy which the rapporteur wishes to pursue to incite the too restive banks to act.</seg>
<seg>We cannot force the banks to carry on a nonprofitable activity, but as policies, which we can do, it is to support the tabled amendment in the name of group PPE-DE by Misters Radwan and Mrs. claiming Peijs whom measures are still taken before the end of the year and preferably that these standards became reality when one starts to use the parts and the euro notes.</seg>
<seg>It is in this direction which the proposal goes that I introduced with Mrs. Peijs: to bring the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we cannot reinforce the political pressure any more.</seg>
<seg>It goes without saying that if the transborder payment systems remain as expensive as today, the credibility of these new parts and of these new tickets will be directly blamed.</seg>
<seg>We are of opinion that this accumulation of statistical data on the domestic payments of the Union are a vestige of passed which is not justified any more in one space integrated, unified, and which it constitutes an obstacle with the proper functioning of the market.</seg>
<seg>To hear the interventions of some of my colleagues in committee, those which attend this enclosure since longer than me, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and the company spirit, to which this Parliament subjects itself for the fourth time, belonged to this category.</seg>
<seg>Honourable Members, I thank you by advance for the support which you will bring to my report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>If one returns from there at the European level, it will be necessary to reinforce the possibilities offered to the areas.</seg>
<seg>Main source of job creation, as well in terms of quality as of quantity, SME indeed play a crucial role for social cohesion and town and country planning.</seg>
<seg>The care which it took to the study proposals and the dialogue that it had the concern of carrying out with many interested parties were an asset for better defining and optimizing the installation of this program.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, we must seek the European added-value.</seg>
<seg>It is followed from there that the small and medium-size companies can live only if unemployment is weak and if the public budgets are free debts and sufficiently supplied to envisage such investments.</seg>
<seg>The companies need clearness.</seg>
<seg>Especially, when a unipersonal company or a company less cash than 250 paid has a project, it must be possible to be given a financing not only with one guarantee with 120%, but also on the simple basis of an good idea.</seg>
<seg>The Nation states, even the regional or local capacities serve already as gigantic pumps with finances, intended to drain the tax money, i.e. the sums taken on the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, towards the large companies and leaving towards their owners and their shareholders.</seg>
<seg>The seedbed of the small and medium-size companies includes/understands fragile thousands of tests which feed the large companies in manpower and ideas.</seg>
<seg>Until I wait of the police chief, in particular among the whole of measurements that we proposed here, it is that it facilitates and accelerates the access to aid and with information, so that the chiefs of SME are able to use information with effectiveness.</seg>
<seg>All these will occupy a choice place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg>Finally I accomodate the idea favorably to give us an annual appointment in order to take stock of the setting in uvre program.</seg>
<seg>The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara make more imperative the need to promote democratisation measures, of institution building and respect for the rights of the man in Albania.</seg>
<seg>A number impressing of Albanian leave their countries due of the insecurity which reigns there, of the social difficulties, of social and family structures prémodernes.</seg>
<seg>We need preventive measures cut to measure for Albania and contributing with construction and the reconstruction of the country in order to allow to live with dignity in this area.</seg>
<seg>Thus documents travel of one authority with other and that the European commission, for example, refuses to make public the report/ratio which concerns, inter alia, also Customs Assistance Mission (CAMWOOD), worked out by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg>Let us try to look at the truth opposite.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Karamanou, congratulations for the widened point of view which governed the design of your report/ratio!</seg>
<seg>It is a very important topic which is worked by factors historical, social, political and economic.</seg>
<seg>We will never know the exact number of victims.</seg>
<seg>The common economic activities create peaceful bonds between the people.</seg>
<seg>What I find unacceptable on the contrary in this report/ratio, and I say it with frankness, it is that one confuses the effect and the cause, i.e. one confuses a procedure for granting balanced of visas, and thus the possibility of migration, with the clandestine cause of migration.</seg>
<seg>The important institutional changes which are the consequence of the treaty of Amsterdam had an impact on the management of the asylum issues and immigration.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly and to finish, the action plan and its method of setting in uvre must be under consideration at the regional level.</seg>
<seg>Naturally, this requirement also invites us us to show reserve as regards European regulations.</seg>
<seg>It is the moment or never to insist particularly on the force of the Community action.</seg>
<seg>I also plead so that proposals codified in the event of current European change to the legislation are introduced in order to integrate the amendments in the directives or existing regulations.</seg>
<seg>The principle of subsidiarity, if it is well included/understood, engages us in two directions: to make the decisions at the level low possible, but to recognize that the level low possible can be very an high level, when the general interests concerned and are threatened if they are not protected everywhere in a uniform way.</seg>
<seg>This report/ratio is a model of concision and of clearness and I hope that my colleagues will hold of it account with serious.</seg>
<seg>The report/ratio of the Affairs Committee legal and the interior market did not cause the enthusiasm of its members.</seg>
<seg>It is with that I referred in report on the draft SLIM, because the community legislation, and Misters Medina us has just proven it with the reading of the one of the articles of the Treaty, is not easily comprehensible, even for the experts.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, certain aspects of the report/ratio fill with enthusiasm me little, because I would have preferred a report/ratio more “communautarisant” with regard to the interior market, and, especially, because the report/ratio does not go in this direction on this point.</seg>
<seg>What is important for the institutions of the Union, they is that we firmly commit ourselves improving quality of legislation, in particular by holding account of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>The persistence of this situation could exert an negative impact on the citizens vis-a-vis the euro.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the Committee on Citizens and of the rights of citizens, justice and the businesses interiors prepared with much care the Karamanou report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>This said, as a chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to benefit from our oral question and this debate to address to me to the two parts - since our motion for resolutions is addressed to the two parts -, and I would like to make with calm some considerations.</seg>
<seg>People of the Union which we represent here claim it.</seg>
<seg>Well from water passed under the bridges, the agreement however came to a end and was not taken back.</seg>
<seg>I can include/understand the reasons of the police chief but not those of the managing director.</seg>
<seg>We could say that, eleven less after the immobilization, we continue to pay the previous agreement and the former one to the former one.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, we held a similar debate here a year and the fact that it took one year to start the negotiations proves how much it is difficult to find fisheries resources for the imposing fleets of the EU.</seg>
<seg>During the second agreement, the things were very clear.</seg>
<seg>But as nothing is eternal, not even the fisheries resources as should be included/understood!</seg>
<seg>Therefore I particularly make a point of saying clearly that if group PPE-DE were distinguished from the different one, it is not only to have supported, have defended and have encouraged the fisheries agreements, but also to have encouraged their extension significantly.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is stopped, the exploitation of the place of fishing of the Sahara by Community and nonCommunity fleets which are subjected neither to control of the Commission nor with that of the Member States continues: one speaks especially about an important fleet of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg>I include/understand it easily, because fishing represents a source of revenue and employment important for this poor region - compared to the European standards.</seg>
<seg>The other point that I would like to underline is that the temporary supports granted with the fishermen and ship-owners in compensation of this year without work finish at the end of the month. It is about an unsustainable situation for them, they prefer all to work rather than to receive assistances.</seg>
<seg>Here a year that, as a deputy of the Andalusian party, I negotiate and I propose initiatives in the corridors, the offices, at the Committee on Fisheries and during hearings with Misters the police chief so that is taken into account the very special idiosyncrasy of the Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco.</seg>
<seg>Spain developed in a remarkably positive way the difficult vicinity which always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>As a Spanish and Andalusian deputy, I assert the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and so that this Parliament also defends, their numbers of jobs, which have been seen endangered for almost a year.</seg>
<seg>We pass now to the vote.</seg>
<seg>A history of almost twelve years, made reassuring words pronounced by the authorities, of tactic of delayed-action, of hopes, also of personal needs, placebos for the people concerned, the obstinate defense of old rights with regard to citizens, who sought only their right good anything else.</seg>
<seg>As you know it, the business is very complex and concerns some seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg>If the Italian legal order is reformed and modified, as that was the case for the university personnel, we do not think that the Commission can intervene since any European citizen profits from an fair access to all the categories of professions.</seg>
<seg>The injustice lies in the fact that two people filling the same task and working side by side receive different wages and are subjected to different conditions.</seg>
<seg>In my eyes, there is however nothing worse than to have to inform people that a judgment delivered in their favour could be only one series of comforting words and not to have any practical consequence on their existence.</seg>
<seg>I recall you, I remind the Commission that I hope for a reaction to the fact that, in the business Allué, the judgment delivered by the precise Court which it is contrary to Article 48, paragraph 2, of EEC Treaty that the legislation of a Member State limits the duration of the work contracts of the assistants in foreign languages to one year with possibility of renewal, if there does not exist in theory any limit of this kind against the other professors.</seg>
<seg>I think however that these businesses touch with the cur even fundamental principles of freedom associated with the European law, more particularly freedom of movement, and no exception can be tolerated with regard to these principles.</seg>
<seg>Like shows it the current debate, we still meet many obstacles, obstacles on the way of this interior market, and not only in this case.</seg>
<seg>We pass now to the vote.</seg>
<seg>(The President withdraws the word with the speaker)</seg>
<seg>In the name of our Parliament, I addressed at once to the president, Misters Thomas Klestil, like with the chancellor, Misters Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages of sympathy and of solidarity in the test that such a drama calls with regard to the victims, their close relations and of the whole of Austrian people.</seg>
<seg>Are there observations?</seg>
<seg>I support the proposal of Misters Ceyhun and I would be very grateful with the Council if it could announce to us if it intends to put forward a new proposal on this business.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, honourable Members, our group considers this incident of an importance such as we think that it would not be treated as it is appropriate within the framework of the urgent debate.</seg>
<seg>I have the feeling which you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I included/understood you well.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, some time ago, we discussed within our Parliament the issue of sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg>It is urgent that we have a debate on this subject before the coming into effect of the proposed amendments by the British authorities; the Commission must also clearly indicate what it of it is right in this respect.</seg>
<seg>(A5-0314/2000) of Mrs. Roure, in the name of the Committee on Citizens and of the rights of citizens, justice and the interior matters, on the initiative of the French Republic for the adoption of one relative convention to the improvement of the legal assistance in area of criminal, in particular in the field of the organized fight against crime, the bleaching of the product of infringements and the financial crime (10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg>The declarations must be followed concrete actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the products of the crime.</seg>
<seg>The creation of an European area of freedom, safety and justice cannot remain in the hands of an specialized agency placed under the only control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg>In addition, article 8 of the draft convention restricted to the only essential interests grounds for refusal of mutual aid which could call upon the necessary State.</seg>
<seg>Above all, I would like to congratulate Misters Marinho for his work and to say how much the fight against crime economic deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance.</seg>
<seg>To locate, continue, condemn the money laundering salt terrorists and arms dealers and of drug: yes, of course!</seg>
<seg>Our task consists to detect, detect, freeze, seize and confiscate the products of organized criminality.</seg>
<seg>These elements are in the amendments and, to judge some by the debates in committee, I have high hope which they will be approved by the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that this set of initiatives evolves/moves in a manner which is likely to reduce to nothing the protection offered by article 6 of the European Convention of safeguard of the human rights and fundamental freedoms.</seg>
<seg>But reality is not also simple.</seg>
<seg>To finish, Mr. President, the group EPP supports the compromise amendment to which we arrived with Mrs. Roure in connection with the activities of lawyers.</seg>
<seg>The second measurement, the second instrument, is the harmonization.</seg>
<seg>Other speakers already greeted this Portuguese initiative.</seg>
<seg>Such was the objective of the joint meeting of the Council “justice and interior matters” and of the Council “Écofin” of last October 17.</seg>
<seg>The best manner of reinforcing parliamentary control and judicial control on Europol, consists in integrating Europol convention completely in the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The creation of a provisional unit of legal cooperation constitutes a step in the right direction, not to which the European Parliament aspires for a long time already.</seg>
<seg>Such is the direction of the guarantees, namely to advance this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament is the Community supranational body of the establishment of this report/ratio, and my intervention thus proposes to you to support the cogency of them by supporting our rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>It is only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice are specified that the citizens and the Parliament will be able to come to a conclusion about the measures which the Council proposes to us.</seg>
<seg>Eurojust is thus a logical stage of this work which aims at giving to the citizens a raised security level, in an area of justice, of safety and freedom, by reinforcing the fight against the forms of crime engraves organized.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, honourable Members, it is necessary to congratulate Mrs. Gebhardt for the excellent report that she presents to us, in the line on one of the decisions taken to the Council of Tampere.</seg>
<seg>But like, with Eurojust, one speaks about the coordination of the prosecutors and of the national magistrates to fight against all the forms of crime engraves - and there I subscribe to the approach of Mrs. the rapporteur - one widens the concept: one does not speak only any more about co-operation for the purely transnational crimes, one also speaks about co-operation for the repression of the criminal activities.</seg>
<seg>We will on the occasion to engage us ourselves in this provisional unit, as of on January 1, 2001, but the Commission wants to support the debate on what must be the final unit of Eurojust.</seg>
<seg>On both sides, there was frank standpoint - me seem-T-it - which however did not lead to inflexible oppositions.</seg>
<seg>The problems which arose for the level of the expenditure it too much did not worry; other fields were much more alarming.</seg>
<seg>It is unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives and that we cannot measure the results; that would not arrive in any other institution.</seg>
<seg>A second point, Mister the Police chief: with regard to the hierarchy as regards competence of scheduling, of the really inadmissible overlappings were noted.</seg>
<seg>I want to underline by there that he played a positive role in a certain number of problems.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that this work in consortium does not establish a duality in the responsibility joint financial.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, we really worked with the recovery of the 3,4 million, and one can say that we carried it out with more than 90%.</seg>
<seg>Are there observations?</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mesdames and Sirs, at the end nine months of work and of a long reaching compromise, here thus the draft Charter of the fundamental rights.</seg>
<seg>Even if it is satisfied today to say “yes” to this Charter, I hope that this Parliament will not let plane any doubt, during the next weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council which this Charter is juridically constraining and which the latter must guarantee the access for citizens at the European Court of justice.</seg>
<seg>This position joined, you know it, that taken by the heads of state and government at the time of the European Council of Biarritz who approved themselves, unanimously and without reserve, the Charter and I can thus only invite you, in the name of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps by indicating some reasons to you.</seg>
<seg>But it is especially by the force of its contents that the Charter, I am persuaded of it, will make date.</seg>
<seg>On its side, the European Confederation of the trade unions could complain about what it estimates to be gaps, like the absence of reference to the right to an minimum income for example.</seg>
<seg>It does not remain about it less than several personalities, and in particular of the members of the European Parliament, proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental is inserted into article 6 of the treaty on the Union, which refers already to the European Convention of the human rights.</seg>
<seg>Our group approved the Charter unanimously, except for the British delegation.</seg>
<seg>As a European popular party, we are unanimously favorable to the inclusion as fast as possible of the Charter of Fundamental in the Treaties, so that it has the force of immediate law for the citizens of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>They showed that one could work on European issues in a new and exemplary way, higher than that of the intergovernmental conference, since it gives to this work an open and democratic character, while making it possible to the citizens to fully exert their right of scrutiny and to take part in it.</seg>
<seg>The right to health, the social security, housing or the minimum income are non-existent or only about solidarity.</seg>
<seg>Fourthly, and it is particularly significant for me, the Charter start from the premise of the indivisibility of the civil rights and policies, on the one hand, and of the social rights, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mister the President of the Council, Mister the Police chief, honourable Members, I believe that this Charter is quite simply the énième demonstration of the capacity of the Union and our Member States to multiply the empty texts, the declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg>The representative of the Commission with the convention of Turin added to the document a legal scope.</seg>
<seg>After the hour of the market, the hour of Europe of the rights perhaps finally arrived. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.</seg>
<seg>The Charter is indeed written like a text which can have a constraining value.</seg>
<seg>I also note with a great pride that a representative of the group of which I form part at the Finnish Parliament, Misters Gunnar Jansson, played a very important part during the development of this Charter.</seg>
<seg>As I said yesterday evening - I repeat it today -, there are too many failures on the matter, everywhere within this Union, and, sometimes, carried by our desire to develop the legal cooperation and police, we neglect the importance to guarantee that the innocent ones do not become passive victims, collateral damage of the war against the crime.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, the project of European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental is founded on same ambiguity as work of the enclosure.</seg>
<seg>The Italian constitution envisages for example the limit of the good habits; convention envisages the limit of the rights of others, of the law and order.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, today, at the time of the vote which will take place at midday, we will put a term at a process which began in 1984, when the European Parliament approved the draft treaty on the European Union, where appeared already the request for a declaration of rights, process that we continued in 1989 with the resolution of Misters De Gucht.</seg>
<seg>The Charter will produce effects. It will produce some, that it appears or not in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>It is to be greeted and not to fear, as seems to think it Misters Bonde.</seg>
<seg>It seems that all the fights for the emancipation of the handicapped social classes of the century which ends were useless and anything learned us.</seg>
<seg>The Charter fills a vacuum in the right of the EC, it reinforces the protection of the people against the attacks of which they could be the object on behalf of the European police force, of the authorities which fight the fraud and of those charged to supervise competition.</seg>
<seg>I do not include/understand those which are opposed to the Charter under pretext that it does not contain all that they would like to see there appearing.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I will continue in the same way that Misters Gahrton.</seg>
<seg>I would like to make a third remark about the rights of people of third country.</seg>
<seg>Just like the Court of the human rights, the Council of Europe has to him also a solid experiment with regard to such forms of control. We can take it for base.</seg>
<seg>Within sight of the text of the Charter that we will approve - with a large majority, I hope - today, it is manifest that we will arrive to a more important protection of fundamental rights and more current than would have allowed it adhesion the European Convention of the human rights.</seg>
<seg>For this reason it is necessary to achieve others not ahead.</seg>
<seg>This point is capital if we want to gain the support of the European population with regard to the Charter.</seg>
<seg>After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental will be my grid of analysis for this report/ratio and, as much as my average personnel, intellectuals and the means as collaborators who will be given to me will allow it to me, I will make an analysis right by right, country by country of the respect of the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Minister, Mesdames and the Deputies, the Commission would like first of all to join the remarks of Misters president Moscovici, and to greet the essential contribution that the members of the European Parliament brought to the debate, with Convention, in particular the role that Misters Mendes de Vigo played praesidium of Convention for the drawing up the Charter of the fundamental rights.</seg>
<seg>I will take again only some of the projecting points of this debate.</seg>
<seg>Convention chose to register fundamental rights inspired of the various instruments of the Council of Europe, treaties and Member State constitutions.</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls common the two following reports/ratios under discussion:</seg>
<seg>In the current state of affairs, it as rests on our Parliament to say to Turkish people as there are today three conditions with his adhesion.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, it would not have been possible to fix conditions only by one decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>This is why I noted well the suggestions formulated by Misters Morillon relating to the prerequisites with the accession of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg>I am happy to be able to say that, in the interval, the Turkish government agreed this partnership like future basis of cooperation, which leaves us high hope arrive to our ends, i.e. to help, by our policy, the forces of reform in Turkey, to give an fresh impetus to the process of reform and to advance it for the adhesion sought with the European Union.</seg>
<seg>For me, the essential element is that Helsinki started in Turkey, in the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions of an accession of Turkey at the EU and that this debate supports and supports the forces of reform of the country.</seg>
<seg>This text is subjected to you for opinion.</seg>
<seg>What one intends to do now, it is to give an necessary impetus within the framework of a future membership.</seg>
<seg>I do not know how will be held the vote but I would invite Turkey urgently to treat this question with serious.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament will play its part in the promotion of the relations with the political parties, ONG and the press, like in the development of its relation complex and sometimes tended with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg>Mr Morillon, your report/ratio is, with my direction, completely realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg>At the time of your visit in Turkey last March, just like today, you at least mentioned the problem of the Kurdish population by name.</seg>
<seg>There are at the same time a great naivety and a great sufficiency to consider that Europeans will bring the Turks, I quote: “with a radical change of their practices and their mentality”.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, honourable Members, the report/ratio which is presented to us wakes up in me serious concerns.</seg>
<seg>Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) Misters Duff and Voggenhuber, in the name of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the approval of the draft Charter of the fundamental rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg>At all events, we will have, the next times that we will discuss the data-processing capacity, to return account to us which it is necessary a broader control and thus more capable to respect the human person.</seg>
<seg>Recommendation Duff/Voggenhuber (A5-0325/2000)</seg>
<seg>As an indication, let us quote:</seg>
<seg>The rights contained in the Charter are already registered in the national constitutions and are defended by national parliaments close to the people and their cultures.</seg>
<seg>For example, article 19-1, which mentions that: “collective expulsions are prohibited”, does not specify that this prohibition can be suspended in the event of war or of serious disorders to the law and order.</seg>
<seg>We give an brief explanation as of these three objections in the order.</seg>
<seg>The right for a government to draw aside its constitution arbitrarily is the definition characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg>But, I repeat it today, we take place any to be proud conditions under which we crossed this big step for Europe.</seg>
<seg>A company knowing only rights, but not duties, becomes an egoistic company.</seg>
<seg>It is our priority combat so that the assertion of fundamental rights is concretized in political choices.</seg>
<seg>As much the Convention method is interesting and fertile to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, as much nothing does not justify that one deprives the European Parliament, incarnating the representation of European people, of the possibility of amending, of enriching the text.</seg>
<seg>This Charter must be improved and our Parliament must propose a strategy allowing its actualization and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, it should not be adopted and proclaimed at the time of the meeting of the Council in Nice: this Summit should rather engage an European debate on this Charter.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the dominant tendency of the national governments seems marked with the stamp of common direction, i.e. that of one Charter to the purely political and nonconstraining range.</seg>
<seg>Created in as well “as enclosure” by the Summit of Cologne, this one car-proclaimed “Convention”, a name which recalls 1793 annoyingly and the terrorist drifts of the French revolution put in uvre by another Convention.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the method which was used, exclusions which were marked and the ambiguity which surrounds nature even of this text throw a rather raw light on the new totalitarian leavens which are with uvre with the cur even integration process European.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the European Parliament has yet in this field only one consultative role, while waiting for the complete application of the treaty of Amsterdam, but it finds the means of making it play in the bad direction, by slowing down the right decisions.</seg>
<seg>As for the manner of proceeding, the designs divergent.</seg>
<seg>In fact, it was thus one century ago from here and, after it was somewhat limited, this right makes now a return in strength.</seg>
<seg>The final point that we want is that the single European market to make it possible to the criminals to be introduced there by an hidden door.</seg>
<seg>We also support the future creation of a convention facilitating the organized fight against crime and the money laundering, as well as the various proposed measures for this purpose.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, one creates a provisional unit made up of representatives of the judges or police officers who carry on an activity of judge in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, as a UE-Turkey member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, I deal enormously with the question of the prospect of membership of Turkey.</seg>
<seg>The attitude of Turkey on the Cypriot question is also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>We approve nevertheless the criticism of the rapporteur, who estimates that it misses, at present, an effective evaluation of the results of the activity of loan of the EIB, and that there exist also failures from the point of view of the right of scrutiny of the public and democratic control of work of the bank.</seg>
<seg>Turkey, in spite of all its difference, belonged always and still belongs to whole share to European reality.</seg>
<seg>The accession of Turkey to the European Union became a question more than ever with the order of business.</seg>
<seg>Misters Morillon declares that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as a “exclusive Christian club” which would like to exclude it, it, Turkey.</seg>
<seg>Turkey will reach truly the democracy, when she learns how to live with her past, as democratic Germany learned how to live with his, and with her also, to him asked it to us.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the authorities of Ankara understand that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, of significant progresses could be accomplished: the island could be reunified and a comprehensive settlement right, durable and in conformity with the international law will be brought tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>To tell the truth, why thus all that remain does absent from European Commission report?</seg>
<seg>It is in this balanced framework that we will have to resolutely continue our action to support the bringing together between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>If you treat the Armenian question in connection with adhesion with the EU - please pay attention to my remarks: to treat the Armenian question in connection with adhesion with the EU -, the project about which we spoke today will not start. It is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg>It is besides also the reason of our insistence so that an assessment is drawn up the first five years of setting in uvre of the process of Barcelona, so that in Marseilles, precisely, we are able to stop the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg>However, we managed to maintain the dialogue and on sometimes significant subjects: stability, terrorism, the emigration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg>It remains that the Council made an effort, in particular since 1995, to equip the Mediterranean with more important means, with the measurement of the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg>It is indeed - and I would like to also say it as anybody originating in Central Europe - about an extremely important file.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, as you know it, there exists an English saying who says that when a high-speed motorboat does not appear at the time of a spectacle, that resembles a representation of Hamlet without the first grave-digger.</seg>
<seg>We want to see joined together the policies relating to the topics relating to the single European market and to lead to an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, parallel to the sub-regional agreements of free trade for all the partners taking this route and adopting the protocol harmonized as regards rules of origin.</seg>
<seg>We learn with great satisfaction that the Commission for giving an fresh impetus to the process of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg>I underlined these aspects because it is there that it is necessary to seek the key of the revival of the process and that it is necessary to add to all that the enrichment of the political agenda of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, it is necessary that our priority is to guarantee peace and the security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make all the possible efforts in the name of this co-operation and so that the committed funds is effectively put in uvre, in accordance with - let us say - the egoistic generosity of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Here are major issues and concrete that I would like to pose, and I thank Misters Brok for having allowed this debate right before the presidency and the Commission can discuss these subjects.</seg>
<seg>The world goes in the direction of an inescapable universalization from now on. In such a context, it is necessary to be organized in main blocs acting as actors in the great panorama of global competition.</seg>
<seg>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries requested only one quarter of the appropriations of come program MEDA-I in the term in 1999 and whose equipment was of 4,7 billion euros.</seg>
<seg>In this direction, the proposal for an fresh impetus on behalf of the Commission is positive and we are completely of agreement with the two priorities that Misters Patten underlined in its interventions and repeated this afternoon in front of this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>It is an urgent warning so that the European Union plays a part much more active in the Mediterranean region which, historically and culturally, contributed to the richness and the size our continent of Europe.</seg>
<seg>But much more serious still, at the time when in this hemicycle we exchange peacefully from the points of view sometimes extremely divergent, always more Palestinians are massacred.</seg>
<seg>Reconstruction aid</seg>
<seg>If we do not find however the means, in December, to put in uvre this payment, that wants to say that the debate which we carry out today relates to an empty shell.</seg>
<seg>This one is often too bureaucratic and often passes by too complex procedures. But we do not have and let us not please close the eyes, and I hope that the Member States do not do it either, on the part which the latter played in this respect.</seg>
<seg>The media in this area were often responsible for the tragedy which it underwent; they must be able to be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg>But I am also happy because I think that the Parliament succeeded, thanks to an uninterrupted pressure, to bring an successful outcome to a situation which was not particularly amusing at the beginning.</seg>
<seg>I repeat it: it is really necessary to avoid spending unnecessarily of the money in superfluous meetings.</seg>
<seg>We should not however not concentrate us solely on Kosovo.</seg>
<seg>I also regret that a number of programmes were put in performance reserve, the reserve of behavior.</seg>
<seg>In Feira, he recognized the quality of potential candidates to adhesion with the countries taking part in the stabilisation process and of association.</seg>
<seg>I recall the main priorities assigned to program CARDS: the institutional strengthening in the sense of democracy and of the Rule of law, economic development and the rebuilding, the regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg>The European Union was right to react positively to the accession of president Kostunica to the capacity.</seg>
<seg>An initial examination took place on November 6.</seg>
<seg>As the European Parliament asked it in its resolution of March 16, 2000, that they initiatives the presidency of the European Council does hope to take to play a more active part in order to guarantee the application full and whole peace plan of UNO?</seg>
<seg>How to arrive to this revival without payment of this conflict?</seg>
<seg>I can simply indicate that France and Germany - there, I do not express myself any more as a President of the Council - mentioned these questions during a bilateral summit in Vittel, last week, and that it was decided to constitute an work group in order to remedy the problem.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the Union continues to bring an important material aid to these two countries, by the means of its various programs, in particular TACIS.</seg>
<seg>The question of the Honourable Member thus gives to the presidency the opportunity to dissipate certain confusions.</seg>
<seg>And I add an additional precision: it acts in particular, in these two texts, to reinforce the penal framework to fight against the organized dies of frontier runners.</seg>
<seg>In the report/ratio which the Turkish Council of Ministers has adopted last on September 21 like programs of reform, appear in the part of the legislative changes several projects: to register in the civil code of measurements reinforcing the effective equality of the men and the womens in the fields socioeducational: to better fight against violences within the family; to better condemn these violences, by the creation of specialized family judges and finally to prohibit the possibility of reducing of sorrow for crime of honor.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the presidency does not have an answer to bring on this point.</seg>
<seg>The next week, it will hold a meeting of the European conference there, with my invitation, in France, i.e. with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>Do you think that the “Austrian” model - namely decision making majority bilateral - will in the future constitute an instrument making it possible to make decisions by being unaware of the European institutions and to found a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity within the Council?</seg>
<seg>The Council was not received this letter but the presidency, of course, answered Misters Cem. The terms of this answer were communicated to the whole of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Of which he Misters the President-in-Office sees he the position of Misters Cem - Misters Moscovici did not answer that - which claims that it is not possible to take account of the Cypriot question, if one wants to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union?</seg>
<seg>It should be known that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than one simple fisheries agreement and, as it knows it, if we had not managed such an agreement, and all that implies, that could have hidden a deterioration of the relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>And for this reason I make a point of expressing my skepticism as for the result.</seg>
<seg>Being the setting in uvre of the principle of mutual recognition of criminal decisions, in accordance with the European Council conclusions of Tampere, it should be noted that this principle must allow the reinforcement of the cooperation of the Member States, but also of the protection of the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg>The supplementary questions must be formulated by other deputies.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the Commission, in the communication which it adopted on October 4, 2000 on the oil supply of the European Union, indicates that it intends to present, to the European Council of Gothenburg, a plan of energy economies and diversification of energy sources which should contribute to reinforce energy efficiency, particularly in the buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg>In this spirit, we launched, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on November 9 last, a call to the cuban authorities so that they cooperate fully with the international agencies which defend the human rights.</seg>
<seg>It thus belongs to NATO to make the provisions which she will consider necessary so that such facts cannot reproduce.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting, adjourned with 18:55, is taken again with 21:00)</seg>
<seg>When one speaks about money, those which give this money have all the same the privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and it is what the police chief always did.</seg>
<seg>This presence, in theory, can open a new prospect for the overall policy which we carry out.</seg>
<seg>If we regard the area as an area of political antagonisms in power, we will make wrong track.</seg>
<seg>The Parliament must be consulted and regularly informed; here is the second request of the rapporteurs, request which should all support to us.</seg>
<seg>The heads of government also confirmed the determination of the Union to support this process by means of an technical assistance and economic.</seg>
<seg>It is the Parliament which supported the Commission proposal aiming at creating the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>As the Parliament knows it, we do not think that it is necessary to envisage an explicit reference on this subject in the payment.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place with 11:30 tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>The leaders are agreed to extend and bring up to date the euro-Asian framework of co-operation 2000, which constitutes the work program for the ten years to come.</seg>
<seg>I think that recalls us, in Europe, the major role which we play in Asia and this, not only in the field of the economy and the trade, although it should be specified that one of the reasons of the re-establishment of Asia is due to the fact that we held our promise to keep our markets open to Asian exports during the two last years.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it was a very good political declaration, but we have still some problems to regulate.</seg>
<seg>We know that the Commission considers the ASEM with more the utmost seriousness, and sincerely let us support we it in this attitude.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms on the level of the transposition of the Community law in order to increase the legal certainty and to overcome current slowness.</seg>
<seg>It should thus encourage the creation of new regional organisations, while starting where there is already a Community presence, as it is the case in the Western Pacific and the southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg>It will be vital for the sustainability of fishing.</seg>
<seg>I think that the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organizations and the whole of the efforts of the Commission, Mister the Police chief, summarize briefly myself. To defend the Nations position, as well in the convention of 1982 as in that of New York, which was mentioned here, our presence in these organizations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.</seg>
<seg>This is why I think that the Commission can play a leading role while going on the spot and by encouraging the fishermen to cooperate with it and to propose a solution to which we all can rejoin us.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the Commission must assume a series of tasks in the field them negotiations which must be carried out within the framework of the ORP.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I encounter the same problem as Misters Nicholson, but in a form even acuter.</seg>
<seg>Mister the Police chief, my honourable Members, here are thus the solutions which the Committee on Agriculture recommends.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes, we are able from there to ask to us whether the cyclical crisis of the market is not, to a certain extent, the result of the speculative action of the aforesaid business structures, who thus make sure control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg>The supplementary aid of the EU proposed by Misters Garot in his report/ratio is, in my opinion, contrary with the common sense in these years of Diary 2000, widening in the Central and Eastern Europe and of agricultural reform of the common.</seg>
<seg>I estimate that it is completely remarkable that the rapporteur showed here what one can do with a little administration when a defined project is continued, which appears clearly in the report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>On a side, the largest producers or those which are integrated with the companies of downstream would hold well off this device, preferring the systems they have already: individual saving, bank loan, equalization fund.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, Mesdames and the Deputies, allow me to say before very that, on the bottom, and in consideration of Austrian agriculture, I greet the Commission proposal favorably to constitute regulation funds.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>I understood well that one wants a common organisation of the market in the intensive livestock sector and a dismantling of the agricultural policy insofar as it is connected to the territory, where it acts of production connected to the territory.</seg>
<seg>There exists already a OCM of the meat pig, and we should not make the error to call it in question whereas, basically, it functions well.</seg>
<seg>According to the Commission, it is right to subject to a discipline only the farmers who take part in the regulation funds, because those receive in exchange a certain income guarantee, while those which do not take part in the funds do not receive this guarantee.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is raised to 23:10)</seg>
<seg>The resources coming from the tax on the added-value account for 36% and the traditional own resources 15%.</seg>
<seg>Another element of the reform is also closely related to a priority identified by the Court. They are the importance increased to grant to the assessment of the results and the performances within the framework of a distribution of resources which meets predetermined priorities and clearly definite and measurable aims.</seg>
<seg>It is a good thing and I would like you to thank, Mr Karlsson, as well as the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, to support the reform of the Commission with this report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>On this subject, it is also of circumstance that I announce to you that, for the intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we proposed to modify the European Treaty so as to be able to create a European parquet floor to continue the fraud attacking the interests Community financials. I really hope that this proposal will not be simply actée at the time of the intergovernmental Conference in Nice or will be slipped under the carpet, but that one will treat it with serious.</seg>
<seg>The reality described in the annual report is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg>The number of mistakes is too high to give such a guarantee.</seg>
<seg>The amount intended for the activities of equipment is of 240 too low million.</seg>
<seg>I would have also wished that the report of the Court of Auditors was a little more convivial and that it had presented some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations per chapter.</seg>
<seg>A convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.</seg>
<seg>The Commission and the Member States should apprehend it in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to reinforce the effectiveness of their management methods of finances of the EU.</seg>
<seg>I know that this report/ratio and the work which the Parliament is about to start in the part of the discharge procedure will contribute to a greater vigilance with regard to the Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg>In this moment, I would wish to conceal to me, Madam the President, and to wait until a member of the Council comes here.</seg>
<seg>As at the time of the other years, the Court did not manage to identify with exactitude the failures.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, the enlargement of the European Union approaches and the report of the Court of Auditors shows clearly that it does not remain yet badly of work to achieve, even in the applicant countries for accession.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, my honourable Members, we recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which consisted in being able to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to keep silence on this subject.</seg>
<seg>I would like “to also badger” the Council and to ask him why the situation does not advance concerning article 24 of the Financial Regulation.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps that a little European common sense will make it possible to solve the problem and to give to George Bush the place which it deserves in the history - the dustbin!</seg>
<seg>We do not have to seek scapegoats, not more in our institutions that in our States.</seg>
<seg>Above all, concerning the procedure of presentation of the annual report to Parliament and at the budgetary Control Committee, I am charmed to hear that the deputies estimate that the situation is this year is more satisfactory than the previous years.</seg>
<seg>At all events, we will have the possibility all of examining.</seg>
<seg>When the audit justifies it, we mention all that owes the being.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, as you noticed certainly, the final part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors were victim of an unfortunate virus, which interposed between its speech and this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Certain amendments, like amendments 1 and 18, milked with questions which interest the United Kingdom basically and it should be said that all the groups of the United Kingdom, that they are socialist, popular or green, defended them with a great vehemence and they were approved by the Committee on the Environment.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, in March of this year, we voted the directive on the funiculars for passenger transport.</seg>
<seg>We estimate that, in this case, the obligations of the manufacturer which rise from the Security Act of the products do not have to burden the trade.</seg>
<seg>We heard the justification of those and the resumption of the industrial arguments mentioned in committee.</seg>
<seg>Since the salesman is able to each time inform the purchaser of the nature of the goods and the reserves as for information, that should be enough.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, I have a last small thing to ask the European commission concerning article 4 relating to the European standards and the question of knowing if these standards must be published.</seg>
<seg>I am satisfied with the exceptions which are made for the shops of benevolence and the non-profit organizations like for the goods of occasion sold on markets or within the framework of sales of private individuals.</seg>
<seg>The reliability of product safety and the assistance after-sales represent an appreciation for the European label at one particularly difficult and crucial time.</seg>
<seg>If we ask the Commission elsewhere to in the near future present a proposal on the safety of the services, one does not see why we would have and would like to regulate here and maintaining the aspects relating to the services, rather than to await the Commission proposal. Because one can already provide that difficulties of delimitation of the various regulations will be posed and that legal uncertainty will increase with time.</seg>
<seg>Some words only in connection with the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg>We make it possible now to open the system with third countries, in particular in the candidate countries: simplification of the procedures concerning the emergency measures at community level in order to be able to provide a rapid reaction on council of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg>This new requirement in the case of does not imply any additional considerable responsibility this kind of shops.</seg>
<seg>To replace the “producing” word by the word “supplier”, as amendment 11 proposes it, would generate more confusion than of precision, since the directive does not offer any definition of the word “supplier”.</seg>
<seg>Although the Commission is in favour of an rapid establishment of the network, the methods must be discussed between Member States about it.</seg>
<seg>Such certifications can always be used as proof but cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable.</seg>
<seg>Having explained in detail why the Commission cannot accept amendments 1,3,4,6,8,11,13,14,16,18,19,23,24,28 to 30,32,33,36, at 34 and, partly, amendment 7, the second part of amendment 21 and first number of the amendments 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept amendments 2,9,10,12,15,20,22,25,26,31,35 and, partly, amendment 7, the first part of amendment 21 and second number of the amendments 27 and 34, since these amendments constitute an improvement and a clarification of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, for Misters Barón Crespo, an Italian Socialist cannot belong to the European Socialist Group.</seg>
<seg>With my direction, there is no contradiction between amendment 12 and amendment 37.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the order, I leave to the President the care to decide some and I recall that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.</seg>
<seg>The Mediterranean countries except EU are confronted admittedly with particularly acute problems of economic development. There is a constant tension which had with disparities between regions.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the respect of the dignity of the legal immigrants, in the spirit of a European policy harmonized as regards immigration, in addition to the legal instruments aiming at guaranteeing an equitable treatment to them, it would be necessary to create aid instruments financial for all these young people who, having finished an academic cycle, superior or academic, in the European countries, would wish to return in their country of origin to begin an community activity.</seg>
<seg>I would like to highlight a factor, which I consider frankly determining to tackle this problem. I want to speak about the inequality in the field of work.</seg>
<seg>Though tardily, the Commission presented a program relating to Community strategy as regards equality between men and the women (2001-2005), who deviates many the previous programmes, in particular fourth action plan, which is completed at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg>In spite of these reserves, I voted for this report/ratio. Initially because it was taken account of several proposed amendments of my parliamentary group and then, because this report/ratio claims the realization of studies of the situation of the women on the national labor markets like on the insufficient access to the social security systems, two problems for which we need relevant statistics, broken down by sex.</seg>
<seg>My party issues serious reservations in connection with the regulation of the sales of products of consumption by the means of the community legislation, just like it issues reserves in connection with the concept of mutual recognition of the standards.</seg>
<seg>This misunderstanding is now dissipated, and the Labour amendments offer the guarantee not to touch with the shops of benevolence and to see them excluded from the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, amendment 15 leaves the free hands to the Commission on the language regime of the agency, which we regard as very worrying.</seg>
<seg>The simplification of the procedure of taking decision, the creation of decentralized operational centres (and not only in Pristina, which is equivalent separating it from Yugoslavia) and the management of the overlapping structure between the board of directors and the Commission can prove to be positive actions to fight against the important bureaucratic failures of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>We will vote consequently against the Commission proposal like against the Parliament report.</seg>
<seg>An adaptation of the existing Community regulations in this field can thus be regarded as justified.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the funds cofinanced by the Member States make it possible to grant more or less disguised public aids.</seg>
<seg>In spite of its serious defects, the Morillon report/ratio goes obviously further the Commission proposal relating to the partnership enters the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>We, we voted against.</seg>
<seg>Following the example rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey progressed on certain plans and that positive signals exist.</seg>
<seg>Since 1987, our Parliament had engaged itself on the way of the recognition, and the adoption of this amendment shows the coherence of the Parliament on this debate.</seg>
<seg>The Union must make more proposals and conceive the accession of Turkey like an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg>Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg>For several years, as a member of the delegation for the relations with Canada, I have been able to observe the operation of one of these regional organisations, the OPANO (Fisheries Organization of the Atlantic of the North-West), in which the States of this area take part, of which Canada, as all those which use at this place of the traditional fishing areas, of which France, Spain and some other European countries.</seg>
<seg>It will not be satisfied that when its own fleet of drain-holes, leaf European flag, makes respect its policy as regards fishing.</seg>
<seg>The important thing is not thus to satisfy the will of hegemony of the Commission by weakening the European position, which would be completely contrary with an proper application of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>Finally, after rough negotiations, we arrived to a final result which it is worth the sorrow to defend.</seg>
<seg>Thus, this proposal, which aims at replacing three directives on the waste incineration, aims to improve quality of the air, water, of the grounds, the health of the people, by reducing the emissions of polluting substances related to the activities of incineration and Co-incineration, and in particular of dioxanes, furans and heavy metals.</seg>
<seg>But I estimate that it is also advisable to underline - and it is an innovation - that it is not only any more about the emission of these substances in the air; that also relates to the emission in water and the ground.</seg>
<seg>The proposal improved during the various examinations.</seg>
<seg>The introduction of more strict limits as regards oxide of nitrogen for the new installations of Co-incineration such as the cement kilns constitutes at the same time a projection and an incentive for the reducing emission, even if the proposed standards do not reflect the best techniques available.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mesdames and deputies, forgive-me - in particular Misters Blokland - for these a few minutes of delay.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, this directive constitutes a major contribution to the reduction of the negative effects on the environment and the risks which they represent for the human health.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament will be honoured, in the name of the refusal of discriminations and the fight against exclusions, and in the respect of the responsibilities for each one, to give an strong impetus to the installation of a device which will make it possible to realise concretely the essential principle of solidarity.</seg>
<seg>One notes however major differences from one country to another; it misses us however statistical data detailed and comparable which would make it possible to draw up a reliable state of the situation, to determine in which country systems are more powerful, and how, which are their weaknesses, etc It is precisely reason for which my opinion, which was written at the request of the economic commission and monetarist, stresses that it is necessary, before to found some rules with value general that it is, as regards health insurance complementary, that the Commission publishes one Green Paper gathering all these data dispersed, which will have been treated, as well as the relevant informations.</seg>
<seg>Until now, they were the subject of a certain taboo.</seg>
<seg>The risk that citizens in less good health and that elderly can fully have access to an private insurance because of the high risk only they represent is unacceptable for the development of our company.</seg>
<seg>The other point of view, illustrated by the initial matter of the rapporteur and shared per number of Members, consists in promoting the regulations and the codes of conduct necessary to found, between insurers, the forms of mutualisation of the costs guaranteeing to all the supply of an high quality of care and to counter the risks to see developing discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.</seg>
<seg>It does not appear at all normal to me that it is the money which determines the turn of passage in a queue.</seg>
<seg>The new Commission proposal of employment and the social affairs which consists in initially drawing up an inventory in the form of one Green Paper then to decide if we need a directive or a recommendation, appears right to us.</seg>
<seg>A discussion is currently in hand in the Netherlands concerning of the structural changes of the system.</seg>
<seg>On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and to articulate concrete key points which will be used as guiding lines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>It is thus unthinkable to consider a solution “size fit” with the problem of the health insurances.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I think that we owe miser on the contents of the report of Misters Rocard - that we congratulate -, who call on the Commission the service of a service, the development of one Green Paper which will enable us to know the current state of the insurances in the Member States and also to consider the future.</seg>
<seg>The two systems rest on a tripod model including/understanding the State, the company and the private one.</seg>
<seg>The European Union already worked out a certain regulation in the field of the supplementary pensions.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I wish to thank and congratulate Misters Rocard for his report/ratio and to congratulate Misters Marinho for the opinion on his commission.</seg>
<seg>This study will be able to constitute the basis of a Commission communication with the Council and the Parliament containing of the initiatives or measurements.</seg>
<seg>As regards the amendments by the Committee on Budgets, I then to say with satisfaction that they all were accepted.</seg>
<seg>We gave our support for the characteristics of the program, as the multidimensional approach of the phenomenon, measurements as regards health, of education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, as well as the participation of the nongovernmental organizations, but also of the same people who are struck of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>That means that we must benefit from the ascending phases of the cycle to return from there to a situation of balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg>I will recall in this respect whom the last Écofin Council has call on the Commission that the assessment of the programmes of stability precisely takes again as of the next year this aspect of long term of public finances relating to the ageing population.</seg>
<seg>One of the positive characteristics of the program of the Netherlands is the special attention given - as I said before - to the impact ageing population on the Treasury in the next years.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, in the case of Germany, the budgetary resultant for the year 2000 will involve a surplus of 1,5% of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg>If one adds to that the evolution of euro exchange rate compared to the dollar, we have a considerable negative impact in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg>In addition, they aim at making compatible a public system of distribution with private systems of capitalization and, obviously, they are also compatible with supports for the creation of specific investment funds likely to bring long-term tax advantages and to help to make deal with the problem of ageing.</seg>
<seg>It is thus the third principle which guides us: the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg>It should be recalled that several lawful proposals are currently under discussion, which will contribute to reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, consequently, I hope for it, consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg>However, this relatively weak incidence does not justify any kindness.</seg>
<seg>Frankly, I was disappointed that the Jospin Prime Minister does not mention eminently positive part played by the Community these last years in his short speech of yesterday.</seg>
<seg>We should obviously determine the reasons of the increased incidence of the ESB, not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg>The food and veterinary Office of the Commission gives already the highest priority to controls of the Member States in relation to the protection measures against the ESB.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the safety of the bone meals, let to me recall you that there exists already a wide range of controls aiming at guaranteeing that the bone meals do not present a risk of transmission of the ESB.</seg>
<seg>Eh yes, as difficult to believe as that can be, it took four years to make pass a measurement which I regard as fundamental for public health protection.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President of the Council, I exhort the Council to be made known finally his position on the payment EAST.</seg>
<seg>In the current location, the only means of stopping the cycle of transmission of the ESB is to completely prohibit the use of these bone meals.</seg>
<seg>On this subject, I would like to point out that the liberal group to which I belong presented an proposed amendment which I hope to see adopting.</seg>
<seg>The policies must change that so that truths responsible for this crisis are penalized and that precise decisions allow a first step towards the end of this tragic crisis.</seg>
<seg>They would thus have to be re-examined.</seg>
<seg>The labelling of beef which was decided, which is a minimum labelling and which came into effect only since two months and half, does not make it possible to suitably recall the origin of the animals and we prohibited well tardily the specified risk materials.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary that the public opinion is fully informed on the characteristics of the test about which I speak.</seg>
<seg>At the time, Mr. President of the Council, you did not do anything or almost, as your similar did not do done anything in connection with the repercussions of Tchernobyl, anything in connection with the AIDS epidemic, anything done in connection with contaminated blood, always with the same reason: not to panic the public opinion.</seg>
<seg>The prohibition of France will cause a massive increase in demand, but the offer is not unlimited and the prices will undergo an extraordinarily heavy pressure.</seg>
<seg>The consumers lost confidence, and to dam up this phenomenon, it is necessary to generalize tests ESB on the bovines and the sheep.</seg>
<seg>It appears more important to me of move in the direction of the Commission proposal, i.e. to take care that the bone meals satisfy the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg>For the remainder, I am completely of agreement - once in a while does no harm - with what my colleagues, Mrs. Ainardi, Auroi and Grossetête, said.</seg>
<seg>Let us go, members of the Council and Commission, you have a financial broad basis to follow a robust policy.</seg>
<seg>The problem should be regulated.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, I am happy to hear here, within this hemicycle, which should at all costs be changed the CAP.</seg>
<seg>We had denounced it, here even, with Jimmy Goldsmith, in his time.</seg>
<seg>The human consumption must be sure.</seg>
<seg>I find exemplary that France determined itself to cross this step.</seg>
<seg>But us let us not help it there!</seg>
<seg>I am thus surprised to note that corpses are still used or transformed under these conditions.</seg>
<seg>The Philips investigation into the ESB has just been published in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg>I would suggest at the European commission also applying the precautionary principle with respect to the French buf.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to know today, since we are always in uncertainty, which are the scientific data, which are the measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg>In addition, I of course have all these proposals, I am not insensitive there.</seg>
<seg>So European citizens say to me that the legislation correctly or was not fully applied, we will then owe perhaps réenvisager the question, but not for scientific reasons. It will have it to be made because the legislation will not have been respected in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The best way of not hearing us, it is not to recommend us.</seg>
<seg>The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements, currently being negotiated with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco play a major role in the clarification and the coordination of these policies.</seg>
<seg>Which proposals the Commission does it make on the matter on basis of Article 31 of the Union?</seg>
<seg>(The president withdraws the word with the speaker)</seg>
<seg>During this period, the objective was to reduce the public deficit in order to obtain more adapted monetary policy, less low interest rates and a greater growth.</seg>
<seg>I always say that the euro will not be introduced on January 1, 2002 but which it is already in our pocket; we have it with distinct fractional currencies, but already let us have we it in our pocket.</seg>
<seg>The ozone thresholds fixed in directive 92/72 were not exceeded in the capital, but it should be noted that no measurement was taken in the middle of the summer.</seg>
<seg>Subject: State aid to the audiovisual sector At the time of a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to cultural industries, a representative of the Head office Competes with European commission estimated that the legal obligations of investment imposed on the chains constituted State aid by the very fact that these investments were made compulsory by the legislator.</seg>
<seg>It must be respected and protected ".</seg>
<seg>However, that does not go from oneself, because this new growth is very uneven and can be accompanied, as we saw in the United States since ten years, persistent phenomena of precariousness, exclusion, poverty, urban ghettoisation.</seg>
<seg>The governments of the Member States refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and too much vague.</seg>
<seg>And in the difficult climate which results from it, more and more of people do not follow any more, are marginalized and excluded.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, we very often hear in this enclosure, a such refrain, the exaltation of the European social model, social economy of market, which one opposes with pride - as much think it - to the wild model of the United States of America.</seg>
<seg>(Technical problems)</seg>
<seg>It is an enormous figure.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, in fact the political levels must be implied.</seg>
<seg>I support the need for better knowing the causes of poverty, I support the preventive actions against exclusion following fusions, industrial changes, delocalizations, rural desertification, hyperconcentration urban, using innovative and concrete answers, implying the social partners, the local administrations and main roads, as well as the joint action of the citizens.</seg>
<seg>We attended a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion like on the role of the social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg>It is about an ascribable formal problem to the fact that, in the Treaty, he is only refers to social exclusion and not to poverty.</seg>
<seg>I think that these proposals constitute a pragmatic answer to your request.</seg>
<seg>However, an approval of the overall strategy in detail does not mean necessarily an approval of the proposal.</seg>
<seg>If we define a clear framework and constraining for the Member States, the various systems having to satisfy these requirements should have more a long period of setting with the test.</seg>
<seg>Renewable energies will not constitute the panacea to solve this problem, but nobody doubts that they will be able to contribute of good part to mitigate it, to diversify the energy sources and to reduce our dependence on hydrocarbons, which, in addition, would not disturb us at all.</seg>
<seg>I here will return on three of our requirements.</seg>
<seg>To define realistic objectives can thus only reinforce the confidence of the citizen in the energy policy to be put in uvre.</seg>
<seg>I believe that a robust policy as regards renewable energies is a symbol for Europe of tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, the European countries must prove through these agreements which they will contribute to the realization of the objectives of Kyoto.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me damage to exclude any type of waste which can contribute to the aggregate output of energy starting from waste - that it is for projects of small scale or within the framework of a more total calculation.</seg>
<seg>The formation of the peat mass by photosynthesis and in the production of chips of wood is comparable with that of other biomasses.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, I inform Misters Chichester that with broad of my area, there is already a quite advanced project of wind mills and that this one is announced promising. I thus invite it to come to realize it itself.</seg>
<seg>The debate on the renouncement of nuclear energy, in Sweden and Germany for example, showed that, without respectful of the environment and competitive possible alternative energies, the discussion turns short. It is inevitable.</seg>
<seg>For this reason the Member States must impose binding targets.</seg>
<seg>I am consequently optimistic as for the potential future of renewable energies in so far as the adequate incentives are installation.</seg>
<seg>I believe that one enormously needs courage to allot to renewable energy the place which it deserves.</seg>
<seg>It is indubitable that a very strong increase in the price of oil more brutally confronts us with the problems involved in our energy dependency towards the fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, we cannot accept amendment 28.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, by doing this, the Commission does not forget that the terms used do not prejudge its right of initiative and that they must be compatible with the single European market of electricity.</seg>
<seg>On 26 participants, the National Commission of reconciliation of Tadjikistan counts only one woman, whereas the country counts 25.000 widows.</seg>
<seg>Studies show that the presence of women in the rows of the gripping forces of Nations peace, although of limited number, improves the relations with the local populations and the moral general of those.</seg>
<seg>The Theorin report/ratio deals with this subject in detail and contains many repetitions which we ask, as a European Group of the European People and of the European democrats, to remove in order to prepare an official document.</seg>
<seg>From a political point of view, I see in the amendment a 19 failure or a tactical fold rather than a compromise in terms of contents, which should in any case be unworthy of the female cause.</seg>
<seg>They were retained captive.</seg>
<seg>Then a Portuguese example, where the doors of the diplomacy opened to the women only after the “Revolution of April 1974”. Our ambassadress in Indonesia, Mrs. Anna Gums, recently showed in Western Timor that the role of a woman and its sensitivity for the problems and the suffering of people, which faced only long a 25 years fight for freedom, can be perceived by everyone and especially by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Very few Member States did it to date. It is said to me that there are two or three of them.</seg>
<seg>This is why it will also be necessary, in the future, to take account of this dimension at the time of the policy development of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the report/ratio does not define this concept, not more than it does not establish distinctions.</seg>
<seg>Please transmit our protest to the Council.</seg>
<seg>They have experiments different, which is essential to the way in which the policy is exerted, in particular when it acts to manage the crises.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>I arrive now at the second point. If one intends to regulate the sector, it is obviously necessary to study a certain number of points.</seg>
<seg>During last weeks, I discovered an strong interest as well on behalf of the international trade-union mediums as of a certain number of trade-union organizations.</seg>
<seg>Second objection. You are thus favorable to the payment of wages for the housewives?</seg>
<seg>All those which currently work with the black would obtain an employment under decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, this project also made it possible two to three families to gather to create a job of domestic help together.</seg>
<seg>We were joined together in plenary sitting in this initial period of session of October, when we learned, at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the courageous reaction of Serbian people and immediately, you remember it, honourable Members, we asked for the lifting of the international sanctions.</seg>
<seg>By doing this, Europe showed the vitality of its civilization in the history of the world and a political capacity creative look to the future.</seg>
<seg>There can be no doubt about the fact that the question of the status of Kosovo is an issue of democracy.</seg>
<seg>In addition, we would like to be likely to prove in Europe which we are able to develop only the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, by recognizing the true democratic principles.</seg>
<seg>I must say that I - by hearing you - extremely had been impressed by your control of a situation oh! how much difficult, at the same time as by your determination.</seg>
<seg>It will be thing made in the next official report, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg>The access to the documents and information relating to the activities of the institutions makes it possible to the citizens to put the institutions of the European Union in front of their responsibilities and stimulates by-there same a greater effectiveness.</seg>
<seg>A fifth major amendment, in my opinion, is that concerning the annual report which must in particular treat documents having to remain secret, or at least which remains secret.</seg>
<seg>The things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive provisions. It is in particular on this point that we introduced amendments.</seg>
<seg>The Affairs Committee foreign, for its part, opposes the idea according to which the document concerning with the foreign policy issues and of safety should constitute, in an automatic and total way, an exception to this rule of law of public glance.</seg>
<seg>If we want that the citizens can really defend their rights, these places of information require well trained collaborators who to some extent take by the hand the citizens in the search of information and which is used to them as guides inside the complex labyrinth of the institutions.</seg>
<seg>Those are essential if we want to prevent that the aforementioned transparency is not summarized with a transparency for initiates.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to be delighted that the Parliament succeeded in gathering a broad majority in favour of a greater transparency.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, opening and transparency within the European Union are not presented in a favorable light.</seg>
<seg>If such is the case, it would be then a bad calculation, it is the credibility and the reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizen which are concerned here.</seg>
<seg>The concept of documents revêt several forms nowadays and we will take care that the access is broadest possible for more the maximum possible number of documents and the most various types of documents.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, we can know the position of the Commission as regards access to public documents by reading the internal handbook which was given, on October 11, with the Commission officials in order to explain the way to them in which they were to treat the requests emanating of the deputies with regard to the access to the documents.</seg>
<seg>This point of the payment must be removed or at least be supplemented by the obligation of catch in account of the interests concerned.</seg>
<seg>The old models of international cooperation with all their old habits and rules of the game diplomatic where all place behind closed doors are not any more setting in the modern type of cooperation only became the EU.</seg>
<seg>We should not make of amalgam between this objective and the role of the Parliament, nor with future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg>I consider that a step ahead was taken towards the possibility for the citizens of exerting their right to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg>It is not however the only one that I thank: Mrs. Maij-Weggen, itself of the group PPE-DE, and who by the means of the Hughes procedure reinforced is the second author of the report/ratio, deserve also sincere thanks.</seg>
<seg>The transparency must become the pillar of all the activity of the European Union, but the right of access with the documents is not enough yet in itself to make transparency a reality.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament asks since the European security policy and of defense is in the future integrated in the Commission structures European.</seg>
<seg>At the time of his intervention before the Parliament, last on October 3, president Prodi has refers to the institutional triangle and recalled that, in a European system based on controls and balances, the fluidity of the operation of each institution contributed to the shared interest.</seg>
<seg>I must recognize that the big challenge of this payment is to give a precise definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg>I make a point of stressing that the Commission could, at the proper time, almost all the amendments, such as the amendments 9,18 and 21 partly, and amendments 23,25,26.1,28 F, 35,38,40.1,40.6,41.1,42,43.1,47,49 and 52.</seg>
<seg>I would like to vote sometimes in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for this reason it is necessary indeed that the deputies have the list of the amendments which the Commission can support and of that of the amendments that she does not want to support.</seg>
<seg>Capital resources of the banks</seg>
<seg>Lastly, and it is there a subject more discussed, the commission invited with strength to make use of the procedure accelerated to put in uvre this legislation.</seg>
<seg>These amendments replace various proposals in the report, which will be probably disallowed at the time of the vote and which will be consequently replaced by the new amendments resulting from this consensus.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, in the light of the excellent vote of support which this report/ratio received, and being given the answer from the Commission this morning, it appears obvious - considering all the parts on which we voted - that on basis of Article 69, paragraph 2, we should give to later the vote on the motion of legislative resolution, in order to allow us to start profitable negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I am sorry to have said that group PPE-DE had also wished that the vote deferred evening, but they is well you, Misters the Coordinator, who came to say to me that you preferred that the question is deferred until the second parliamentary term of November, rather than to vote this evening.</seg>
<seg>The reason for which I would suggest that we give the vote is - as said it Misters Goebbels - that it is a very important matter.</seg>
<seg>I do not know how much the vote by roll costs, but they are undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, our budget.</seg>
<seg>I know that in France, the principle of demolition of the whole herd was applied and that does not seem the best means of fighting this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg>to remove the bone meals of the animal nutrition, not only of that of the bovines and the sheep, but also of that of porcine, the poultries, fish;</seg>
<seg>That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>It is by provisions as these that the consumers will be reassured and that the farmers will hear the message of solidarity which we wish to transmit to them.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to go more far from any urgency, it is necessary to change the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg>Prohibition to use the bone meals for the livestock feed is only the first step in this way.</seg>
<seg>We deeply regret, on the other hand, that the tabled amendments by our group were not adopted.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it would be coherent that the working hour of those which work in polluting companies is reduced.</seg>
<seg>I will finish while insisting again on the fact that the generalization of the exploitation of hazardous waste should not lead us to adapt to us to the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, if the retirements, for example, were less weak, there would be less the poor.</seg>
<seg>The report/ratio considers an envelope of 100 million euros over five years to decrease poverty.</seg>
<seg>I unreserved supports the proposal to put in uvre a process of Luxembourg (a) in the field of social exclusion, comprising guiding lines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the report/ratio asks for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>By submitting its programme proposal to fight social exclusion, the Commission answers the call launched by the Council to present “from here to June 2000” a “initiative of co-operation in this field”.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I abstained from for a very precise reason: in my opinion, this report/ratio did not make, from the ecological point of view, progress which I hoped for and wished.</seg>
<seg>I wish that such a system be extended to all the towns of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Certain European Parliament proposals are unrealistic and cannot receive my adhesion.</seg>
<seg>We must also manage in the future to better make know the best existing practices.</seg>
<seg>The concerned highest salaries of the environment are seen offering the possibility, on a liberalized market, to voluntarily contribute to a cleaner energy, while for the others, any remainder like front.</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls common following motions for resolutions under discussion:</seg>
<seg>These three reasons are the following ones: firstly, because it abounds in the direction of the consolidation process of the democracy and in that of the reinforcement of the requirement of the respect for the rights of the man, particularly with regard to the indigenous populations.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, in this debate, we wish to express, like it said very well the other deputies who preceded me, solidarity and the support of this Parliament for the Parliament of Central America, at one moment when we fight so that the priority in the framework of the external relations of the European Union with the countries of Latin America is maintained.</seg>
<seg>I do not issue the reserves which could express our comrade and expensive friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Misters Seguro, with regard to the question of the human rights.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central America, the Commission insists again on the importance which must be granted to the integration process regional, as an instrument of consolidation of democratization and development of the region.</seg>
<seg>To cling to the capacity he did not hesitate to seize throbbing debate over “the ivoirity”, causing a blaze of xenophobia: hatred of the other, abroad, the Burkinabe or the Malian, and yet they are numerous with living and working on the ground of the Ivory Coast since many years.</seg>
<seg>The introduction of a true democracy in Coast-in Ivoire could not from now on be done without the institution of an independent commission of inquiry on the committed crimes and without official engagement to make respect human rights and civil peace.</seg>
<seg>Some think that the importance of the democracy is relative when it is about Africa, that they are complex procedures, that it is necessary to leave time to time. However, me, I think that there is no possible compromise with the democracy and the question which arises today for Coast-in Ivoire is the same one as that which is posed for example for Guinea, where one knows today that there are people who are imprisoned and whom there are not democratic system.</seg>
<seg>I will finish by the following thing: the dictatorships are not created, Mr. President, that because there are people which suffer from misery, which does not have access to the knowledge, which do not have access to knowledge.</seg>
<seg>It would not be illogical that the European Union requires today new presidential elections in which all the candidates could this time take part.</seg>
<seg>In very many parts of Africa, we are confronted with ethnic and religious mixings very different.</seg>
<seg>These elections must allow the representation, with the national scales, of the political parties which were excluded at the time of the presidential election and compensate, thus, was this only partially, the imperfections of this first election.</seg>
<seg>on the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg>The authorities carry out a great offensive directed against the people Shan and Karen, and like indicated it the rapporteur of the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the SDPC and the LND.</seg>
<seg>This is why, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg>I hope that by giving an urgent nature and priority to this topic, the Parliament sends to Burmese people a clear message, meaning to him that its desperate situation is not forgotten, that not naps conscious owing to the fact that in Burma, the things worsen rather than it do not improve, and than we are determined to try to make change the course of events.</seg>
<seg>That lasted a long time.</seg>
<seg>In Asia, the danger exists that the economic reforms and policies are uncoupled, that a liberalization and economic progresses are born without political liberalisation of the sector and strengthening of the rule of law, although I would be of opinion that, in the long term, the absence of Rule of law harms the trade, the subsidies and the investments.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I can join the previous speakers on many essential points, because much of things which occur to Vietnam today are unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, the Human Rights Watch publication, which quoted Misters Swoboda, affirms that Vietnam recently made certain efforts to improve her situation from the point of view of the human rights.</seg>
<seg>These extremely confidential documents get a glance curious to us on the slides about the policy followed by the Vietnamese authorities.</seg>
<seg>The Commission remains nevertheless convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can be obtained only by the means of a dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>The Vietnamese authorities exert also clear pressures on the press of the country so that it adopts a mode of self-censorship.</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls common following motions for resolutions under discussion:</seg>
<seg>We also ask the EU to lend assistance and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also with all the other affected regions.</seg>
<seg>I ask you with all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg>It is urgent that the Union stops being limited to exceptional interventions when the catastrophes arrived.</seg>
<seg>The Commission took two initiatives in this direction.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, a purely linguistic error of order slipped into one of the amendments to the resolution commune.</seg>
<seg>A postponement of the vote would mean carryforward of the mission entrusted to the Commission.</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament adopts the resolution)</seg>
<seg>The report/ratio is based on the observation according to which an increasingly large proportion of the health insurance in Europe east covered by insurance systems supplementary health.</seg>
<seg>I find a little strange to want as of now forcing the Commission with a motion for resolutions and to ask him in the same time to establish one Green Paper on the current state of the voluntary insurances and the complementary health insurances.</seg>
<seg>At one time when the ageing population is quite sensitive, it is essential that we try to improve the health-care system of health in Europe.</seg>
<seg>We cannot obviously guarantee it.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, there are undeniable arguments in favour of the procedure accelerated for the setting in uvre of the re-examination of Basle on the adequacy of the capital resources.</seg>
<seg>As for the sense of urgency that Mrs. Villiers added to the feeling of need for the Commission by calling her vux an accelerated procedure of adoption of these measurements, one is obliged to note that the rapporteur himself recognizes that this new regulation will not have any catch on the anticompetitive practices which, unfortunately alas, are widespread in the United States.</seg>
<seg>We must also take care that the decisions taken in Basle do not involve, by an increase in the requirements in capital resources, a second disadvantage for the banks.</seg>
<seg>This being said, I believe, and I would like to underline it, that the economic operators are, them also, satisfied of the approach given to these regulations on the capital, which reinforce the issues relateds with the risk.</seg>
<seg>These are there some ideas on the way in which we could arrive to a fast legislative process, controllable and effective within the framework of the current rules of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the hour had just recognized that the institution of “European Ombudsman” sufficiently lived and that she already sufficient brought evidence of her maturity to have her own budget.</seg>
<seg>Group PPE-DE supports the opinion of the Committee of the Constitutional Affairs, joined it to affirm that competences of the Mediator must be widened, and that earliest will be best, particularly in the field of the capacities of investigation of the Mediator, fixed by article 3 of the decision of 1994.</seg>
<seg>A mediator of course is subject to confidentiality rules, but for the citizens, it is good to know that or that which fulfills this function can have access to the documents to which them, as citizens, do not have access.</seg>
<seg>The presented report/ratio thus had as an aim the recommendation sent by the mediator to the Commission to allow the candidates and candidates the contests organized by it to consult their corrected copies.</seg>
<seg>We think that the Community institutions should carry out their recruitment procedures of personnel, in the same way in fact that all the recruitment procedures, with a maximum publicity and of transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of partiality, injustice or administrative incompetence.</seg>
<seg>I refer here to an amendment concerning the requirement of the undeniable proof of the course of an oral test, for example.</seg>
<seg>Misters Bösch already exposed here briefly the amendments brought to the report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>I posed two questions to the Commission on the management and the organization of the last internal competition, and I received his share of the precise and detailed answers.</seg>
<seg>It is there the beginning of a process of opening and transparency of the form of government.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, the corrections of the examinations organized by the Commission are always made in an anonymous way.</seg>
<seg>It acts, obviously, of July 2000.</seg>
<seg>VOTES</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament disallows the proposal for a postponement of vote)</seg>
<seg>. (OF) During the evaluation of the directive on the capital resources of the credit institutions it is necessary scrupulously to consider several interests which are in conflict.</seg>
<seg>Thus was born the idea from an European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>It is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European popular party.</seg>
<seg>The social situation in the majority of the Member States of the European Union is currently of such nature that the need for a border cooperation between the various police services is indeed important.</seg>
<seg>The majority of the speakers who expressed themselves until now seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent headquarter.</seg>
<seg>The énième provisional decision, but nonprecarious, the small present which the Council was accustomed to make at this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur would like to see more prevention of criminality, of assistance, innovative developments and of border surveillance and wants to also modify the internal security in order to include the respect of the law and order.</seg>
<seg>These was there the ideals that they proposed to us and it was the kind of State there for which they uvraient.</seg>
<seg>I would be in favour of a balance of the standards in certain Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Since the first reflexions on this file, which took place at the European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission committed itself with respect to the Member States promoting an action intended to develop what we could regard as a European police culture, centered on the highest standards as regards deontology, of respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens, and of effectiveness in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg>It leans rather for the development of a Police College especially from the intergovernmental point of view.</seg>
<seg>For the reasons stated above, the members of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>. (SV) I have voting against the report on the provisional establishment of the European Police College.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and heavy and that it is very difficult for them to act quickly vis-a-vis these problems.</seg>
<seg>Of course, proposed regulation is not perfect, owing to the fact that there remains related to the payment “Brussels II” which excludes the children whose parents are in divorce pending, as well as the children designed except marriage.</seg>
<seg>My mother knew such a divorce and removal 85 years ago and she always speaks about it.</seg>
<seg>I would like consequently to say to Parliament that, in action plan on mutual recognition of judicial decisions out of matter civil - we hope that it will be adopted before the end of this year -, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority are granted to the extension of the scope of implementation of the regulation of Brussels-II and, therefore, of this regulation on the right of access, to cover without any discrimination the children resulting from married couples and the children resulting from nonmarried couples.</seg>
<seg>We pass now to the vote</seg>
<seg>Nowadays, the sport - it should well be said - is closely related to other economic sectors like that of audiovisual industry or promotion and the sales of products sportsmen.</seg>
<seg>That which we need, it is of an intelligent and flexible means to interpret the existing rules.</seg>
<seg>I.e., a true attack on democracy even if we avoid looking at the things from this point of view.</seg>
<seg>The Commission consequently expects to receive soon an answer to its request for detailed information concerning the measurements envisaged by the British government.</seg>
<seg>The proposal was initiated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement made before the examination of the budget, six months before the declaration of complete budget of spring 2001.</seg>
<seg>Again, I thought that what said Misters Simpson was really used to reassure us with regard to the probable intentions of the British government.</seg>
<seg>The congestions make us lose not only much time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment and I thus think that if the British government engages indeed the necessary funds with the resolution of these problems, it is for the benefit of each one and in particular of all the European citizens.</seg>
<seg>We are more or less the only oil producers of the European Union and yet we are confronted with the prices of highest gasoline and diesel of all the European countries - GBP the 1,20 liter of diesel in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament must state to them that it is at their sides, and I propose to you, once again, to observe the minute of silence which expresses our solidarity and our emotion.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, it is to support it completely, since I belong to those which asked for the inscription of this point.</seg>
<seg>We carried out good projections.</seg>
<seg>The Union will look further into its relationships to the whole of the main groups and, as soon as possible, will also contact the new American administration.</seg>
<seg>Taking into account is the report surprisingly brilliance of Misters Prescott on the way in which it had negotiated itself, how done that not only Mrs. Voynet but also, I think, and it is my final question with the police chief there, the majority of the other ministers European Environments rejected that?</seg>
<seg>What one can fear, it is that the dash is not lost, that the US negotiators do not change and that all is not to be started again in May.</seg>
<seg>This time, in fact the forests proved to be the principal stone of obstacle.</seg>
<seg>If this warming continues, part of the territory of the countries of the European Union will be transformed at sea or into desert.</seg>
<seg>The standard of living is raised there and the price of the low oil products.</seg>
<seg>I congratulate the Wallström police chief on the efforts which it provided to $the Hague and wishes him to have more chance.</seg>
<seg>Undoubtedly, was it not to have an agreement better than to have an agreement which is bad and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal with the reduction, completely unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The climate changes have reaching consequences in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>I repeat this idea in his English formulation: Forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg>Only this credibility will make it possible the European Union to direct the speech and the action of the COP6 “B” in Bonn.</seg>
<seg>We will have to make our own evaluation what did without and to prepare the documents for the contacts to be established with various parts and, obviously, with the “umbrella group”.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the continuation of the next COP6 or the continuation of the COP6 will be the ratification of an agreement in the Union.</seg>
<seg>Before the European Council, we will still hold next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, to which I invited Misters Brok and Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, Monday at the time of the Council “general affairs”.</seg>
<seg>The participating minimum number of Member States should be fixed at eight while the clause of European appeal to the Council, which currently constitutes a genuine right of veto, would be replaced by a right of evocation.</seg>
<seg>One can regret it, but I am obliged to make this report.</seg>
<seg>The European Council will also discuss the progress of the negotiations of adhesion, and thus widening.</seg>
<seg>The European Council of Lisbon had approved orientations aiming at promoting a innovating and competitive European economy.</seg>
<seg>The consumer protection constitutes a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.</seg>
<seg>We must be ready for this considerable widening.</seg>
<seg>Such is, in final analysis, the ell to which we will have to judge the Summit of Nice.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>First is that the candidate countries must adopt and put in uvre the community asset. It is the task which they share with us.</seg>
<seg>We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental and we do not want simply to proclaim it.</seg>
<seg>Admittedly, the text could have been better, and one will be able to improve it and specify it after Nice.</seg>
<seg>I find simply inadmissible that several governments purely and simply swept table the question of the insertion of one reference to the Charter in article 6 of the treaty.</seg>
<seg>You do not want to even integrate it in the Treaty, which proves that this text was to be put on side.</seg>
<seg>We will speak with one voice disgracieuse within OMC.</seg>
<seg>Considering the rather dark prospects for success of the intergovernmental conference, I think that it would not be convenient to add to the order of business this complex subject and discussed.</seg>
<seg>I launch an urgent appeal with the French presidency so that it does all that is in its capacity to fill this particularly destroying ditch.</seg>
<seg>The Commission, as regards trade policy, worked out a proposal which must be examined carefully.</seg>
<seg>Although the Previous Treaty made some progress in the field of the extension of the formula, it also introduced this foolish formula of the matched joint decision of the unanimity for the citizenship, the social security, the rights of the independent people and also the cultural policy.</seg>
<seg>The simple fact that this question is put watch in oneself clearly the absence of a common of strengthening of ties of mutual trust between the countries which compose the Union.</seg>
<seg>It is exactly in this situation that the intergovernmental conference enlise since months, because nobody wants to give up his toy.</seg>
<seg>The experiment of this year makes us say that the developments to be brought - after Nice, while looking towards the future of the Union - to the process of constitutionalization of the Union should not be entrusted to the obsolete method from now on of the confidential negotiation between government representatives.</seg>
<seg>If the majority does not become the rule, the process of decision of decision will be enlisera inevitably, as has just pointed out it so precisely Misters Prodi.</seg>
<seg>If this aspect of subsidiarity is very important, did not hear us speak during the debate about today.</seg>
<seg>It is what we did, the widening of 1995 was adopted, we passed to the think tank chaired with wisdom by Carlos Westerdorp, Amsterdam arrived, we are today the day before the Conference of Nice and the situation practically did not develop, Mr. President: we return from there to the institutional problems, without finding solution who allows us to complete an ambitious task, I want to speak about widening with 27.</seg>
<seg>Let us not add to disappointment that will cause Nice, so naturally the Council proves to be unfruitful, great disappointment that our Parliament would cause among the people.</seg>
<seg>In the past, we proved that it is possible to achieve this goal and, being originating in a Member State which profited from a project of transition planned towards adhesion, I hope sincerely that we will arrive at widened and peaceful Europe.</seg>
<seg>But it should well be understood that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have it too.</seg>
<seg>But it will be necessary to proceed to a first transition for the elections from 2004 because a certain number of new Member States will join us before or during this legislature which will run up to 2009.</seg>
<seg>The president of the Council tackled the question of the reinforced cooperations and he said that one progressed towards a consensus on the matter.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, first of all, Nice relates on the necessary reforms and the remainders in the prospect of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>If we had were this only some features of this mentality, if we less insist on the things which go badly on our continent and a little more on the things which are well, we would be a little happier than in this moment.</seg>
<seg>We should not only extend the qualified majority voting in force to the Council of Ministers with goods transport, we must include the services, the investments, the intellectual property and the competition which are bound there and consequently adapt article 133 subparagraph 1 of the treaty.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the granting of such a right to the European Parliament would leave also free rein to the arbitrary character of the policy of party about this significant ultra question.</seg>
<seg>Thus it is also necessary, as one among you said it, by referring to American optimism and for the way about which the Americans speak about themselves, it is also necessary to be able to develop what goes and what advances.</seg>
<seg>I would like to also say that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and tiny countries.</seg>
<seg>We worked much, but we encounter these standing problems, and I do not believe that the evolution can be started by the movement of only one country, because we encounter realities, once again, main roads, policies, democratic, very strong in twelve safe country fifteen.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, Mr. President Védrine, you raised a situation perhaps too tended and spoke about a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg>Generally, could you take measurements aiming at reinforcing safety so that such events cannot reproduce?</seg>
<seg>I believe that we must take measures which we never yet took until now, so that the guests of this Parliament feel here like hosts, and do not have to fear threats.</seg>
<seg>Hospitality here, hospitality and respect over there.</seg>
<seg>I you thank myself for your contribution, Misters Tajani.</seg>
<seg>The best homage to Ernest Lluch and his memory would be to respect its message - dìaleg as a Catalan. Can we all give him his chance to the Basque Country?</seg>
<seg>Of course, on another side, everyone can express its opinion.</seg>
<seg>B5-0550/2000 of Misters Brok, in the name of the Affairs Committee foreign, of the human rights, the security policy and the defense policy, with the Council, on the political situation and the humanitarian aid in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg>When I speak about organization, I also think of the European Union which deploys from if major efforts and who, in my opinion, must obtain to be able to assume the responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg>In the second place, you will note in the resolution the very clear will of the Parliament to make put back the security policy and of defense on two balanced pillars: civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, military management, the two pillars being complementary.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, being given the delay which was taken and my obligations, afterwards, I will try to shorten a little the intervention which I had prepared.</seg>
<seg>These relations will take in particular the form of meetings between the Council of the North Atlantic and the COPSI, and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidates and/or allied.</seg>
<seg>Take, for example, which occurred in Balkans, where one can say that each one played its part fully.</seg>
<seg>We also during this time held very informed the United States of the developments in hand with the title of the European security policy and defense, which is an indispensable condition so that it develops harmoniously, as it is the case in this moment.</seg>
<seg>The second edition of the annual report of the European Union on the human rights was presented to the European Parliament. A forum on the human rights will be organized in Paris on December 13.</seg>
<seg>This policy, you say, does not have as an ambition to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the base of the collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg>In addition, if I mentioned the figure of 100.000 soldiers, that does not mean that we ambitionnons to exceed the objective laid down at Helsinki, but which we have a reserve in qualifications and different specialities which makes it possible to guarantee that the 60.000 men of the objective of the Council would be reached, whatever the operational conditions of their employment.</seg>
<seg>Allow me, Mr. President, Mesdames and the Deputies, to in a few words evoke the major political sense, approved by most of our public opinions, of this new task by which Europe a tool of political influence which it acquires missed.</seg>
<seg>The problem with which we are now confronted is to guarantee that, when we speak to consolidate the liberal democracy in Europe, we think of the whole of the continent of Europe, because such is well the goal of widening and the process of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary for us to integrate in a coherent whole three distinct elements: Community policies, the PESC (including the PESD) and the action of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>In spite of our hard procedures, we do not need a force of 60.000 men to fill our objectives.</seg>
<seg>It is thus necessary to urgently set up a solution of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg>I am not agreement with the cynical ones which affirms that Europe thus sees itself equipping with an unusable toy. Admittedly, it is true that, in many situations, the rapid reaction force could not be mobilized directly.</seg>
<seg>The EU should not obtain a clean defense with fixed manpower.</seg>
<seg>To conclude, I will express deep concern that the members of my group and myself feel vis-a-vis the constant aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan. I would like to exhort the Commission and the Council to make all their possible, to intensify the efforts to arrive to a peaceful settlement and to come in assistance to the people civil, in particular in this moment, with the approach of the winter.</seg>
<seg>To say the things very simply: where, when and under which conditions the European rapid deployment force will have it to enter in action in the future?</seg>
<seg>It makes it possible to include/understand the appalling assessment of these two months of intifada: 270 dead, majority Palestinian, and nearly 10.000 wounded, often handicapped with life.</seg>
<seg>From where its relentless efforts aiming at setting up an arsenal of weapons of mass massive one cannot lugubrious any more.</seg>
<seg>In the second place, as opposed to what declared the previous speaker, I do not know if it is possible or desirable that the European Union makes more than what it did not already deal with the conflict and the escalation of violence that the Middle East knows, especially now, in this transitional period which the United States crosses.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I will concentrate in my intervention on the report/ratio of Mrs. Lalumière, report/ratio which I find formulated well conceived and clearly.</seg>
<seg>But there is no political concept and there still does not exist really of foreign policy and security policy.</seg>
<seg>The only problem of the EU is that up to now, she did not manage to collect the interest of the public opinion for this type of actions in spite of the fact that they are considerably more durable and more effective.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, it still remains, of course, the budget and the question of knowing how to distribute it.</seg>
<seg>I say it in spite mass of apparent guarantees which miraculeusement were miraculeusement advanced on the subject during the last days.</seg>
<seg>For the time being, this capacity is seriously lacking to us and it will be necessary, at the end of the day, that the Member States consider their programs of defence spending which differ enormously from one country to another.</seg>
<seg>Even those which wonder about the utility which can result from a decision as that aiming at creating the European army what is called must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The presence of a Minister for defense for the first time in this Parliament constitutes such an historic event that we reserved the night sitting to you so that our deputies are not impressed too much.</seg>
<seg>For all these conflicts, a management not military crisis with preventive measure is better than a military management.</seg>
<seg>Does Russia want, in the long run, to remain plain with an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg>Therefore, Europe will not constitute a new alliance, as I intended to evoke, I believe, by an incompletely informed development.</seg>
<seg>I received a motion for resolutions, in accordance with article 42, paragraph 5, of the payment, to close this debate.</seg>
<seg>Considering the extent of the task, four commissions were concerned and a new procedure was installation, with four parallel reports/ratios.</seg>
<seg>The whole of the proposed measures in white paper must contribute to modernize and make effective all the functioning of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It would be thus good that the reform is the occasion to limit their intervention in the only fields which do not imply an expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The differences in appreciation which appeared are not only of political nature, but reflect even more the cultural divergences between the Fifteen.</seg>
<seg>The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, vice-president in charge of the reform, will have as main task the analysis of the functions and the internal control systems which exist within the Commission.</seg>
<seg>To work together was a pleasure, and I think that the fact that we were all the four there implied looked further into and enriched the treatment by a crucial reform of the Commission, reforms who am essential for the future of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>They can expect to be transferred towards other European institutions, with being detached near the national governments or working in the private sector.</seg>
<seg>Also, our constitutional committee recalls it its attachment at a strong, independent, effective, transparent Executive Committee and politically person in charge.</seg>
<seg>As a Committee on Budgets, we consider that the drafting of the budget by activities presents problems due of the lack of visibility of the expenditure and our desire to reinforce the capacities of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>This will mark, in an obvious way, the good will of this Parliament with regard to the setting in uvre of this reform with the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, first of all allow me to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg>It is a shame when it is thought that the European Union is posed as a champion modernization of the economic life!</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, in spite of the effort of the rapporteurs to support work of the Committee, one did not bring yet a coherent global response and of the committee of the independent experts, answer which aims at a management policy and not only of better administration of the institution.</seg>
<seg>This change of attitude must result in a transparency of the administration.</seg>
<seg>For me, there does not exist any structure whose importance is larger. These are fifteen nations, tomorrow twenty or more, a whole continent, the part of the world most industrialized, which live in the Union and, by it, in the Commission and its structures.</seg>
<seg>The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg>By doing this, nevertheless, the Socialist Group estimates that the current Community functioning of the administration public is rather effective.</seg>
<seg>The result is known and attracts itself the devotion and the competence of the majority of the components of the Commission and its administration.</seg>
<seg>Several thousands of project applications await an evaluation since more than one year.</seg>
<seg>The debate, as we saw, does not relate as well to the principles, the objectives or the appropriateness of the reform as on the procedures, the rate/rhythm, the calendar, the possible dysfunctions or the nondesired consequences of its setting in uvre.</seg>
<seg>I would like to start by communicating to the Parliament - as announced it Misters Van Hulten presently - which the meeting of the college of this morning adopted the draft agreement inter-institutional establishing an advisory committee of the standards governing the public life, such that exposes it action 1 of the action plan of White paper.</seg>
<seg>I think that Misters Van Hulten once again insisted on this point during the debate.</seg>
<seg>The main objective of this recasting is to simplify the procedures, to increase the transparency and to reinforce the budgetary rules, which will result concretely in a decrease in the number of exceptions and special systems incomprehensible and, therefore, by a greater effectiveness on the level of the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg>It is indeed not very economic for the Commission which the texts provide a payment of 20% at costs X and 30% at the costs Y and which then, there is regrouping and checking of the documents in proof for the small amounts.</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls the report/ratio (A5-0337/2000) of Mrs. Sauquillo Pérez LED Arco, in the name of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, effectiveness of the relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impacts of reform of the Commission on these relations [2000/2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg>These final aspects touch ONG particularly.</seg>
<seg>Of course, that is not sufficient, but that must put to us despite everything with the shelter caricatures on the weakness of our development assistance.</seg>
<seg>We will return there, because that constitutes in oneself a framework of quality.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I returned today of Mozambique, country where the European Union provided a humanitarian aid of great quality following the floods. However, of the reconstruction projects for which funds were already allocated are, once again, delayed in waiting of a signature in Brussels.</seg>
<seg>Vis-a-vis these realities, the need for a greater implication and a greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and the underdevelopment is essential.</seg>
<seg>We now have a framework harmonized for the development of the national strategy documents and the indicative programmes of co-operation in all the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>Who more is, the creation of SEM did not put a term at the disparity which existed between eight bulky administrative resources.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mesdames and the Members of Parliament, Madam the Police chief, if I particularly made a point of being with you today for this debate on the first maritime package in the European Parliament, it is because you will examine three important texts, which constitute a first essential step on a subject that the recent events unfortunately put at the order of business topicality.</seg>
<seg>That could allow, moreover, from the point of view of the presidency of the Council, to discuss with the Member States to obtain an agreement of the Council according to your proposals and to adopt the text in single reading, if necessary in the majority qualified.</seg>
<seg>This targeted rapid response and, concretized by the two packages of measures Erika and the six proposals, launched an important dynamics.</seg>
<seg>The lesson which this Parliament in her debate of this morning must retain is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are, all over the world, in a state of disorder, and that we must harness ourselves with the task to put order at it.</seg>
<seg>We must send a clear signal to the ships not answering the safety standards and mean to them that we will not tolerate them any more in European water or the European ports.</seg>
<seg>For the small tankers, we adopt a compromise position between the ceiling of 5.000 tons which had fixed the OMI and that of 600 tons that the Commission fixed.</seg>
<seg>These data will have to be availability of the authorities European, of the Member States and harbour, as well as interested public.</seg>
<seg>Nature transborder of marine environment, which implies that pollution in a zone can have effects on a wider area, requires the creation of a community framework of co-operation as regards accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg>The protection organisations of the environment are also implied in the cooperation at local level.</seg>
<seg>To modify the directive in the direction of a greater rigour in its application, of an harmonisation of legislation, in particular with regard to the selection of the ships subjected to the inspection, and the field of application of the various types of inspection, is obviously positive.</seg>
<seg>I would still like to point out that the urgency that you call upon now does not take place to be.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the liability limit of the organizations of classification, it is appropriate for my direction that the Council and the Parliament look further into the reflexion, independently of what will be decided today.</seg>
<seg>A black box, a black list, all the things of which we occupy ourselves actively. But I want despite everything to underline some points.</seg>
<seg>Vis-a-vis this disastrous situation and anarchistic of the maritime transport, Europe took up the challenge and, eleven months after Erika, the European Union will be capable to announce that never procedure will not have been worked also quickly.</seg>
<seg>One measures how much the liberal thinking is opposed in fact to an high level of maritime security.</seg>
<seg>Whatever, finally, the technical measures which will be taken, one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as much as one will not have rebalanced, in the Manche zone and North-Atlantic, the exponential growth of the traffic related to the hypertrophy of the Sea ports of North.</seg>
<seg>It would be all with the honor of the president according to the Council to give the things in order, also in its own country.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, since the loss of the tanker Erika, a package of measures was born, under political pressure, in order to at sea improve safety of the ships.</seg>
<seg>Greek ships ran, without there being the least storm in trimmings, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, I think that it becomes clear, in this kind of files, that it there not of relation between our oil supply on the one hand and the fact that we always use fossil fuel on the other hand.</seg>
<seg>Thus let us have finally the political courage of our ecological ambitions.</seg>
<seg>It is to say that, in this field more than in very other, our responsibility is large and we must, seems to me it, to make conceal any institutional clean love.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is capital that Russia is recipient of these agreements.</seg>
<seg>I think at the same time of the reinforcement of the requirements concerning the construction standards of the tankers, of the improvement of the supervisory rules of the ports, and also, consequently, of the tightening of the regulations applicable to the classification society of the ships.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, we speak today about the maritime security on the basis of three report/ratio on which I congratulate the rapporteurs cordially.</seg>
<seg>As for these three new proposals on the maritime security, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs who have, within an extremely short time, proven at which point our Parliament is given to adopt new measures to reinforce safety at sea, controls, the construction standards and shown that it is more tolerable only similar accidents occur again.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, our continent was recently struck by series of maritime disasters of great scale, implying particularly tankers.</seg>
<seg>More than 80% of the accidents are related to human errors, but there are reasons with the human error, which are of social order.</seg>
<seg>One or a member of Parliament used the term of “traceability”.</seg>
<seg>The state control directive of the port is conceived to check the respect of the international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.</seg>
<seg>Amendment 18 binds port state control to the rest periods of the sailors, even if the application of the provisions concerning the work hours of the sailors is already completely covered by directive 99/95.</seg>
<seg>I am happy to see that the rapporteur introduced a reference, in amendment 21, with the special system of control, and I give our assent with the principal idea of this step, but underlines nevertheless that the formulation must be refined in order to clarify the things.</seg>
<seg>Amendment 4 and the part of amendment 18 relating to the point K are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>I can ensure you that if a ship-owner thinks of making register a ship under these houses, it would have any interest to think on it of twice within sight of our proposal.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. the Police chief spoke during 18 minutes, and during all this time, it quoted tens and tens of articles, and it declined the position of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Draft decision of the European Parliament and the Council concerning a whole of actions relating to the transeuropean network of collection, production and diffusion of the statistics on the expiries of goods will intra and extra-community (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201 (COD)) (economic commission and monetarist)</seg>
<seg>By withdrawing our resolution, I express however the conviction that our Parliament would have better done to hear its voice while devoting, for Conseil of Nice, a resolution specific and distinct with the so important and so difficult topics to the intergovernmental Conference, rather than to treat them within the framework of one only resolution also including all the other points of about an agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg>(More than twelve deputies being raised, the oral amendment is not retained) (the Parliament adopts the resolution)</seg>
<seg>Relationship (A5-0337/2000) of Mrs. Sauquillo Pérez LED Arco, in the name of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, effectiveness of the relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impacts of reform of the Commission on these relations (2000/2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg>I voted against in sign of protest against the fact that the European Union does not manage yet to intervene as it should also do it in this matter.</seg>
<seg>Although the proposal to amend of the existing directive on control of ships just like the Watts report/ratio do not meet the actual requirements, they mark some steps in the right direction. For these reasons, us, appointed European of the Communist party of Greece, let us have voting in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg>One can thus deplore that the Commission proposal did not take up the idea of the creation of a true European body of monitoring, on the model of the “coast guards” in the United States.</seg>
<seg>The safety of the ships, the protection of the life at sea and the environment require as a preliminary that one attacks the impunity which the ship-owners enjoy, that one takes of very strict measurements for the control of the state of the ship and that one imposes of the severe penalties on the shipping companies who violate the safety rules, that one improves the conditions of the sailors, that one gives them a suitable training and that one guarantees of manpower on board which meet the increased requirements of the ships.</seg>
<seg>Alas, the Hatzidakis rapporteur makes the opposite.</seg>
<seg>The shipwreck of Erika which has occurred in December 1999 was at the origin of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community political agenda and it is under the pressure from the European Parliament which the European commission proposed the texts that we voted today, almost a year after this disaster shipwreck.</seg>
<seg>The existing compensation funds were badly fed, and this appeared only too clearly in the case of the catastrophe of Braer, following which the fishing industry of Shetland Islands was compensated too little in comparison for the incurred damage.</seg>
<seg>I already said, Madam the President, that in the past I on the occasion to sail.</seg>
<seg>The proposals of the rapporteur aiming at the harmonization to the European level can be only positive.</seg>
<seg>It is about an important shutter since he relates to the classification society of the ships.</seg>
<seg>It would be rather a great success, because Europe which we need, with the eve of enlargement, is not rigid supranational Europe, hierarchical, remote, but Europe flexible and close to the people, therefore founded on the respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg>The fight for the capacity that are delivered more and more openly many Member States scrambles the prospect for possible compromises.</seg>
<seg>The Summit of Nice will have as a main task to guarantee the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU.</seg>
<seg>At one week of the Summit, I have high hope personally!</seg>
<seg>I am not either in favour of an automatic bond between the VMQ and the joint decision and, here as, I think as any decision aiming at extending the capacities of joint decision should be examined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg>By modifying article 133 of the treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend the qualified majority voting, currently into force with the Council for the trade of the products, with other fields like the public services, the intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg>Thus, the Parliament avoids exerting an influence, it lowers the voice and keep silent itself in the name of fidelity partisane, main road and governmental, thus forgetting its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg>I also voted against a text which requires the incorporation of the Charter of the fundamental rights in the future treaty which will be adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg>The fact of sharing the Union in teams has and B is an error, and I thus disapprove the idea to authorize a third of the Member States to precede the others.</seg>
<seg>Its new role put a term at the traditional neutrality of Ireland, of Sweden, of Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg>There are many elements to which the British Conservative Group can give its support in this report/ratio, in particular insistence on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg>The social democrat deputies Democrat in the European Parliament decided to support the report/ratio on common security establishment of a common European and of defense.</seg>
<seg>But also against people of the European Union which will have, in any event, to finance the new expenditure on armaments which the report/ratio preaches and which will not even have the guarantee that these military forces are not a day used against them, in the name of the “maintenance of law and order”.</seg>
<seg>It is serious also to want that a State not wishing to take part in a mission is obliged to pour a financial contribution which will be distributed between the States which take part in this war.</seg>
<seg>The external military means do not bring any solution, because that does not remove the origin of the conflict and does not change the public opinion.</seg>
<seg>· the fact that military operations would be financed by a budget line of the Community and that the Member States would have to contribute financially to the operations even if they do not wish to take part in it (paragraphs 49 and 50)</seg>
<seg>The EU would have, on the contrary, favours to modify the priorities sets within the framework of the missions of Petersberg and it should center its efforts on the realization of civil and humane tasks.</seg>
<seg>I support the report/ratio of my colleague Mrs. Maj-Britt Theorin.</seg>
<seg>But one evokes the needs for this category to only make pass the request for a tax deductibility of the domestic services " and for a “adaptation of the prices and costs to the financial resources of the private individuals”.</seg>
<seg>It is incredible all the same that we must still recommend to XXIe century that the Member States guarantee to domestic staffs the right to security social and to the pension.</seg>
<seg>For much of young people, the initial contact with the job market is likely to take the form of an employment to the black.</seg>
<seg>The things worsen when it is question of women of distant countries who accepted this work by need and who do not have any other possibility to continue to provide for their vital needs.</seg>
<seg>The reform of the Commission will be judged on parts, from where need for regular monitoring reports that the European commission will present during all the duration of the programme and the importance of the complete assessment awaited for December 2002.</seg>
<seg>. In a still recent past, various scandals and dysfunctions led, in March 1999, with the resignation of the European commission.</seg>
<seg>To finish, I believe essential to recall that through this reform, essential for the future, we await all at the same time more rigour and more transparency of the Commission in his day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility of its share, in the strict framework of competences which are reserved for him.</seg>
<seg>The conservatives also support the assertion of paragraph 7 of this report/ratio according to which it is necessary to take care of democratic control and the operation of the system in three pillars.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is raised to 13:15)</seg>
<seg>We learned - and I make a point of adding immediately that I cannot believe in it - that the president of the Council and the French Republic will be present tomorrow during about thirty minutes, in order to speak.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, it appears to me excluded that we have a thorough and argued position.</seg>
<seg>No matter what he in oneself, votes, and me I am in favour of a resolution like it suggested Misters Poettering, Misters Lannoye and others.</seg>
<seg>One worked on these texts until in the night, just like on the figures relating to the weighting of votes in Council and the distribution of the seats in our Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, I sincerely hope to intervene in favour of the maintenance of the report/ratio of Misters de Roo to the order of business because it was very well prepared and must be the subject of a common position at the time of the last Council of Ministers the environment of the French presidency which will be held next Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg>At the Affairs Committee foreign, human rights, security policy and of the defense policy - that Misters Brok chairs - he smokes while sitting.</seg>
<seg>The political basis is clear: to harmonize the market by taking account of an high level of protection of the public health and consumers, while being based on the existing regulation and by promoting the scientific point of view.</seg>
<seg>It goes from there their conditions and design of life, in which health protection occupies an increasingly important place.</seg>
<seg>This rule can apply besides to all récréationnelles but dangerous drugs in so far as the consumer of drug is the only one to run risks.</seg>
<seg>Yesterday, in the United States, of the lawsuits were gained against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on the not-toxicity of the products.</seg>
<seg>With regard to export by the EU of cigarettes prohibited, for health reasons, of the centre even of the Union, we think that the only sensible solution and logic are to put a term at it.</seg>
<seg>Rather than to learn the lessons from the failure recorded at Luxembourg, last on October 9, we persist in a juridically indefensible attitude.</seg>
<seg>I studied with attention the statements by Commissioner addressed to my colleague Misters Hume: “No massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg>It is at the Parliament and the Council to approve this proposed directive and to examine, inter alia things, its proper legal basis.</seg>
<seg>I do not think that one can borrow a also restricted way, i.e., independently of the contents - and substantial contents which highlighted Misters Maaten and others - one runs the danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation suggested by the leader of the European popular party and Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the European institution Community find feet and fists related to the level of the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of the Community law.</seg>
<seg>The weak point of the proposal is that it strongly places the accent on the promotion of the free competition.</seg>
<seg>I will say as a conclusion that, since the treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the capacity of coordination environment consumer protection, and that he will work obviously in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters.</seg>
<seg>In fact, that does not have absolutely anything to see with the tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of justice of the European Communities could also have involved an advertising ban for alcohol or the chocolate, since it is known that sugar can also be dangerous for health.</seg>
<seg>I really do not manage to understand that a majority of Members can wish an easing of the rules as regards export compared to the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - governments which also represent the many industrial circles concerned.</seg>
<seg>It is a fact that 80% of the smokers want to stop, but the tobacco industry sets up only few policies to help these smokers to stop.</seg>
<seg>If we entêtons ourselves to dictate with the other countries the public health standards which they should apply by extending our completely judicious proposals for the interior market to exports, we will endanger excel it work provided by Misters Maaten.</seg>
<seg>We are favorable to the application of a uniform test method recognized by all the countries of the EU, who must be put in uvre by a test laboratory approved in a country.</seg>
<seg>The effects of tobacco consumption on health today are amply recognized, and the legislators and public opinions share the same feeling that it is time maintaining to adopt Draconian rules and regulations for this product.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the community rules would be in good harmony with the future international agreements, which would avoid us the danger of the trade barriers and would consequently reinforce occasion the consumer protection, while ensuring an high level of public health.</seg>
<seg>It would be preferable to wait until the overall question of the additives is treated within the framework of the first Commission Report.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the laboratory tests, the treating amendment of the approval of the tests is superfluous since another article guarantees the movement of goods which are in conformity with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, this report/ratio is all that there is of simpler: currently, the directives immediately of summer have only one period of five years validity, it after which they must return before the Parliament to be renewed.</seg>
<seg>Committee on Industry, foreign trade, research and energy. Madam the President, my honourable Members, the proposed directive concerning the relative tendencies at the summer-time, which we examine today, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg>I think since we should not extend us too a long time on this subject, since the Member States and the population already largely accepted the regulation immediately of summer and that this one was recognized like integral part of our annual rate.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, it is good that the questions of time zones and application of the directive immediately of summer remain competence of the Member States, as the proposal envisages it.</seg>
<seg>It would be more reasonable to put a term at the summer-time at the end of September, approximately six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg>It can nevertheless give its assent with the idea to make suitable proposals on the basis of conclusion of the report of 2007 mentioned in article 5.</seg>
<seg>It was specified that no test leading to modifications of the genetic identity of the participant can be accepted.</seg>
<seg>If we approve it, we will nevertheless have a regulation which guarantees therapeutic progress and the protection of the patients in the current state does not leave, but improves it. This is why I plead in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg>These groups must be maintained in the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg>I am also happy that we managed to put parapets at the genic and cellular therapy.</seg>
<seg>I hold to congratulate the rapporteur, Misters Liese, for his work, and to thank it for the efforts which it made in order to reconcile the opposite points of view.</seg>
<seg>These programs relate to the fight against cancer, the prevention of the AIDS, the drug prevention and health promotion, and their interruption would mean the stop of the actions concerned and work of the networks which were set up.</seg>
<seg>It is very advantageous of being able in advance to level the ground, so as to progress as much as possible, to bring us closer largely and, if a second reading would be necessary, to make so that we are practically at the point to slice.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, we should not lose sight of the fact only so much the prevention and the promotion which vigilance will be increasingly more important and which it will consequently be necessary to equip them with more important budgets and to attach a greatter importance to them.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, following the Trakatellis report/ratio concerning the extension of certain existing European programmes in the field of the public health, I would like to express my concern in connection with the direction in which the policy public European Health evolves/moves.</seg>
<seg>According to my information, the Council also gave its agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg>In the European Union, paradoxically, abolition of frontiers interior in order to support the free movement of the goods, people, services and capital is accompanied by the maintenance of 15 borders in the fields of the police force and the criminal justice, from which the Member States have evil to be freed.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, the initiative represents a considerable progress towards the creation of an judicial area European criminal, although partial and limited, but she meets the actual requirements of a considerable mass European citizens who, when they are victims of one infringement outside the territory of their usual State of residence, are up to now practically without recourse.</seg>
<seg>What did we thus ask for these groups of people?</seg>
<seg>It is necessary at the same time to guarantee a special training of the professionals in direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg>The victims cannot become doubly victims, victims of the undergone crime and victims of the system.</seg>
<seg>In this context, it is essential also that the close relations, the family of the victim, are informed of the facts in a discrete and professional way if they emit the wish of it and can also count on the necessary support, by preventing that they learn all the details by the press.</seg>
<seg>This principle is worth whatever the type of crime in question.</seg>
<seg>That it is on the level of the Member States, or that of the Union, we should never deviate of the fundamental principle according to which any individual must constantly assume the responsibility for his acts.</seg>
<seg>In other cases, it could be possible to obtain the useful informations in language of the Union which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg>I am very satisfied with the reaction favorable of the Parliament to this first text on a so crucial subject, which allows the area of freedom, of safety and justice that we gradually build to offer to our fellow-citizens an assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.</seg>
<seg>Vote on request for urgency</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament rejects the urgency)</seg>
<seg>Thus, in the night of the 23 at November 24, we found an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is however reasonable.</seg>
<seg>The Commission had also proposed a revision to the amount of 300 million euros.</seg>
<seg>But I as learned how from the discussions as it is much more difficult to arrive at the formulation of a position of the negotiable Council, to receive a mandate and to make emerge purely national selfishnesses in a European joint decision so much is not very reasonable and justifiable.</seg>
<seg>I hope that work for recruitment office common, like one says in German modern, i.e. authority European of recruitment, will advance really, so that we can answer the problems which will arise at all the institutions - with the Council as at the Commission, the Parliament and the other institutions - in the next years, namely the need for personnel.</seg>
<seg>The Council refuses to carry out this revision - it seems that us should have the data right now - and I would like to prevent it: to use the flexibility instrument financially two consecutive years - indeed, in less than fifteen months and the first with less than six less approval of the prospects - vacuum the flexibility instrument because it prevents its renewal and its possible accumulation, which is envisaged until height of 600 million.</seg>
<seg>This very important amount, which answers the existence of very high requirements in 2001, could in particular be financed thanks to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument with height of 200 million euros.</seg>
<seg>It is by taking account of this new element that the Council voted in second reading an budget increase of 2,5%.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, before you did not carry out the definitive adoption of this budget, I wish to underline the attachment of the Council to the compliance with certain budgetary rules basic, as regards retention of appropriations, basic legal and of classification of the expenditure.</seg>
<seg>And contrary to Nice, the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and Commission - are all, I believe, satisfy with the final result.</seg>
<seg>Mesdames and Sirs, the reappearance of bovines reached by the ESB makes necessary an immediate action in the budgetary context, and precisely for health protection, the consumer protection, but also for aid to farmers concerned with this situation.</seg>
<seg>Moreover the Council defined, for the outline programme of reconstruction aid in Balkans Western, an multiannual amount, certainly indicative, which is compatible with these financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg>Of brave fight, we managed to obtain a few million additional euros.</seg>
<seg>I thank Mrs. Haug very sincerely.</seg>
<seg>He thinks since this percent of the Union budget is used advisedly.</seg>
<seg>If I include/understand well what you said, we should not resort to the reserve because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg>I thus think that we saw very good things, in addition to much of others, that I cannot mention now because of the brevity of the speaking time.</seg>
<seg>Although the agricultural appropriations, which represent almost half of the total budget, increase of more than very 5% by taking account of the rectifying letter, the total rise of the budget is only of 3,5%.</seg>
<seg>We already now perceive the great danger which the opposition is not accentuated in the next years between MEDA, the projects for the countries of the Mediterranean and Balkans, whereas we know all that there is an urgent need of funds in this zone.</seg>
<seg>Satisfied to have overcome the difficulties which made so narrow the way towards the required objective to fill the commitments entered into in Helsinki towards the candidate countries without demolishing the Union, to allow Europe of tomorrow to continue to function with effectiveness.</seg>
<seg>They are real, even if they also do not go far the presidency - which made proof, I note it, on a purely national basis, of a large opening - would have wished.</seg>
<seg>A new legal basis is planned for the status of political parties Europeans and the Parliament sees itself entrusting the statute of institutional applicant envisaged to article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>These last weeks, three significant progresses were made.</seg>
<seg>It is the direction of the declaration adopted in Nice and the reflexion engaged to coordinate with the European level the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg>Among the threats, there is, each one knows it, climate warming.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, in Nice, the European Union set up the permanent body necessary to the definition and the control of a foreign policy and to security policy: a political committee and of safety, a military committee and a European staff.</seg>
<seg>For this co-operation, for your support and also for your reception, Madam the President, Mesdames and the European Deputies, the French presidency thanks you.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>We must now examine the text to Parliament thoroughly.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>I see there a failure not only compared to the ambition proclaimed of the European Union to change the institutions to be able to correctly accomodate the novel members by improving the effectiveness of the European Union and I see there a failure also compared to another major task, which one evoked perhaps too little, the bringing together of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg>The right questions, it are in our eyes those which the impressive human tide was carrying which, of all Europe, converged towards Nice the day before the Summit.</seg>
<seg>Initially, the Fifteen signed on the run and under teargases the Charter of Fundamental.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>My group is disappointed by this Treaty and anxious for the future that it prepares us, also will oppose we to it us of all our forces.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, you have the word.</seg>
<seg>I already answered on this point and I subscribe completely so that he said on the need for improving the public debate considerably. I will not return on what I said, but it is true that, too often, the citizens feel foreign with decisions which are made in authorities that they do not know.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would like to know well if the power of the European Parliament as regards summer-time is a new conquest of the Summit of Nice.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps discouraged hitherto by the complexity of the clinical trials, the laboratories will find, in the will expressed as well by the States as by our Parliament, courage to develop the market of the paediatric drug, even if this one is not sufficient size to allow a return on investment!</seg>
<seg>Is it necessary to renew the change of summer-time which had been instituted at the time of the oil shocks, with an aim of energy saving, and which had been extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg>The victims are not always protected as it should be within the framework from criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg>Many travellers and holiday makers will thus profit from this European initiative.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, time for me to greet the Misters President of the Commission which is there and the presidency of the Council which advances, and to stress that, probably never in this Parliament, such a unanimity was not expressed on the results of a top.</seg>
<seg>That which goes, it is that which, under the crook of the French presidency, in six months, has, seems to me it, all the same accomplished its work on six essential shutters.</seg>
<seg>However, my greater fear, it is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now able to reverse the delicate balance which had existed between States of different sizes and the institutions for several decades.</seg>
<seg>In fact, there is evil to see, in this decision of Nice, which is specific to facilitate widening.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, honourable Members, I can be very in short today.</seg>
<seg>Consequently of all that, when we proceed to the vote on this treaty of Nice, my vote could be only negative.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the most important result of the meeting of Nice resides in the fact that one is despite everything parvenu with a treaty, so that we can now prepare their place in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>Victorious truths of this conference, they are Misters.</seg>
<seg>Then, let us forget Nice, look at after-Nice - and you will allow me to place my hope in the project of grand convention advanced by Belgium for its presidency, because the proof is made, it is necessary for us to make of the nine, it is necessary for us to change method, it is necessary for us to accelerate the history: 2004 it is too late, it is too far, they are too dangerous.</seg>
<seg>Instead of that the spirit which reigned in Nice was, instead of wondering how to advance really Europe, that to wonder how one could block, how one could obtain a system of decision at the intergovernmental level, how one could praise oneself, once sunken at home, to have been the defender of the national interests.</seg>
<seg>It in front of what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, it is Europe of the princes, Europe of the national administrations, and not Europe of the political unification.</seg>
<seg>We cannot continue without qualified majority decision on the essential topics.</seg>
<seg>It is true that - I will paraphrase Misters Bayrou - I have been with this bench for this morning; initially with the sides of the president of the Republic, then by myself and criticisms fuse, seems to me it, moderate, friendly, but critical all the same.</seg>
<seg>It should not be forgotten that it is the first time, in fact, since 1957, qu ' one reforms, that one revises really the grid.</seg>
<seg>We are in constitutional systems and the capacities cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg>I thank you warmly, Mister the Minister.</seg>
<seg>But it was not incorporated in the Treaties and was not mentioned in article 6, paragraph 2, of the treaty on the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, there exist some positive elements: the new version of article 7 of the Treaty, the article on the political parties and their statute, the right of this Parliament to represent the other institution before the Court of justice - it is also an important element of political control -, the new formula for the European commission, which puts what is called the “law Prodi” in the Treaty, which reinforces the president and the new composition of the Commission - compromise reasonable that I accept and who will function, with time, and, like my colleague, Misters Tsatsos, pointed out it, the way towards the future.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, we already devoted ourselves to a rigorous evaluation from what occurred to Nice, but it is advisable to recall that Nice started from a very restricted order of business.</seg>
<seg>Let us observe the things: the charter was not included in the Treaties, it is not even mentioned.</seg>
<seg>We want to prove to the heads of government whom we can better do.</seg>
<seg>In spite of the eulogistic statements made on its own subject this morning by the French government, the IGC did not finish well.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the French presidency not being present at this debate, it is not easy to criticize it.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the Summit of Nice proved that the method of the intergovernmental conference made its time.</seg>
<seg>Budget 2001 (continuation)</seg>
<seg>That does not mean however that one could do more and better.</seg>
<seg>These maximum obliges the Commission to fix priorities within the limits of a determined budget as any authority must do it.</seg>
<seg>The vote which will follow this debate will conclude a length and complex process of adoption from the Union budget for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg>It is what we did: we avoided a budgetary crisis while returning in article 272; the financial perspectives were maintained, even if we used the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg>Just allow me to say to the Council that, relating to this play, there remain to us balloons and that, on this side, we intend to play as long as we will not have obtained the good performance.</seg>
<seg>We do not want only one proposal for a revision for the next year appears already in the Colom resolution, because we want to await the evaluation of the World Bank, but we share his critical point of view when she affirms that this manner of solving the financial insufficiency in category 4 denatures the multiannual character of the broad objectives external of the Union and the definition itself of the financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg>So that all this is possible, we will have to define, for the future also, of the priorities of extensive scales.</seg>
<seg>It is only in this manner that the money which is placed at the disposal of our fellow-citizens, will be used correctly and judiciously.</seg>
<seg>If we already add to this calculation the BRS to come, one arrives almost at 8%, whereas in all the other fields - that it is of the education policy, all the field of the actions at home, including research, the foreign policy, the administration and accession aid -, we have only one growth rate of 1,1%.</seg>
<seg>Since this collaboration is so good, we will on still certainly the occasion to continue it in January, at the time of the presentation of the supplementary budget.</seg>
<seg>Criticism towards the relations between the Baltic Russia and States which still could not be regulated satisfactorily is also appropriate us.</seg>
<seg>We follow with great interest development of society and of the interior policy to Russia.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, honourable Members, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Even if president Putin guarantees to us the democratic development of his country, he is not automatically the guarantor of stable and democratic Russia.</seg>
<seg>We should not be insidious but on the contrary to build Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the Caucasus, Misters Van Orden is right perfectly.</seg>
<seg>If Russia of outside is observed and that one receives direct impressions punctually Russian partners, one quickly runs the risk of speaking in a selective way of a Russian reality which is in fact the image that one was made oneself of Russia.</seg>
<seg>On the political plan, the common strategy proposes in Russia to engage a permanent dialogue on the policy and safety and to create for this purpose a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg>In this paragraph, I wanted to underline how much it is important to mark the fact well that Russia is really in political union with Bielorussia.</seg>
<seg>Do you think of supporting such a project, Misters Patten?</seg>
<seg>In this context, as the Parliament knows it, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi started a depth dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg>I sincerely hope to go personally to Kaliningrad to the beginning of the year next, and not only because Emmanuel Kant passed all his life there.</seg>
<seg>I once more congratulate the honourable Member on his excellent report, which relates to a subject of very great importance, on which I am sure that we will still lean still and within this Parliament during the next years.</seg>
<seg>You put to me in a very difficult position.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the crisis of the mad cow has enormous effects on the food products, manufacture and the food import.</seg>
<seg>The Council expressed its concern at the numerous meetings with Russia, on all the levels, to lead it in particular to avoid the excessive use of the force as well as a possible extension of the conflict, to proceed to independent inquiries and effective on the rights violations of the man, to support the assistance group of the SOEC in the achievement of its mission and finally to take care of the routing of the humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, it is a point of order: it is usual in this Parliament that when the questions were not the subject of a satisfactory oral reply, they are treated then in writing.</seg>
<seg>(Interruption of Misters Posselt)</seg>
<seg>This directive goes back to 1992.</seg>
<seg>It is in this direction that it will be necessary to work.</seg>
<seg>These groups are not the subject obviously of an exception in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg>The presidency and several Member States already received European Committee of the sugar manufacturers various mails relating to the Commission proposal of which they will hold account in their deliberations.</seg>
<seg>question nº 6 of (H-0886/00):</seg>
<seg>I would like first of all to say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council did not answer the question of Misters Korokas yet.</seg>
<seg>It is now necessary to set up this authority and I believe that the growing awareness of the European authorities is strong and that it will be necessary to go from the front one.</seg>
<seg>Concretely, the representative of the presidency, in fact the ambassador of France in Algeria, did it meet Misters Ahmed Taleb?</seg>
<seg>We are pleased with proposed arrangements in this respect by the committee preparatory and decided by the General Assembly with regard to the mode of accreditation of the governmental organizations, with the preparatory process and the extraordinary session of September 2001.</seg>
<seg>The partnership comprises several references to the European Convention of the human rights.</seg>
<seg>As the Council put forward it near the Honourable Member in his previous answer, the process of mutual recognition of criminal decisions will allow a better protection of the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg>I would like to still press it.</seg>
<seg>It ensures in particular the political control and the strategic direction of an military operation of crisis management.</seg>
<seg>I would like simply to recall that the system of the Treaty makes a treatment difference between the taxes and the indirect taxes whose harmonization is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - it is article 93 - and the bringing together, envisaged in article 94, of the legislations which have an direct effect on the establishment or the operation of the Common Market, among which appear those which relate to the direct taxation.</seg>
<seg>Tokens a short glance on these three great fields.</seg>
<seg>If the traditional attitude whereby “in the doubt, remain enemy” persists, that could explode the Stability Pact of Europe of the South based on the principle of cooperation regional.</seg>
<seg>We also need the co-operation with Yugoslavia and more precisely a bilateral cooperation.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, our group supports completed work by Misters Baltas concerning the report on the possibility to negotiate an agreement of stabilization and association with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I had, during the years when I exercised the mandate as President of the parliamentary Parliament of the Council of Europe, the occasion to accompany by many Croats in their efforts towards freedom and the prosperity which they identified with their integration in the European institutions, following the example other people of our continent.</seg>
<seg>Within sight of the results recorded by Croatia this year, I will acknowledge you that I do not doubt our capacity to progress to sharp pace.</seg>
<seg>It is well what we think, and the diligence with which we adjusted our policy with regard to Croatia these last months testifies some.</seg>
<seg>We must in Croatia bring to the government and to the people of this country all possible aid in the years to come and we are very grateful towards the honourable Member who with wisdom to incite us to proceed in this way.</seg>
<seg>On this subject, it is incomprehensible that thousands of members of Laskar Jihad could, in spring, to go in Moluques in order to poke the conflicts once again there.</seg>
<seg>In Timor, militia block the return of the refugees and the first-aid workers are made badger.</seg>
<seg>In the name of the Committee on Industry, foreign trade, research and energy, I will limit myself to three points.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, honourable Members, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs. Maij-Weggen for his excellent work.</seg>
<seg>However, in this respect, the country does not make exception.</seg>
<seg>The ceaseless violence whose Moluques, the province of Aceh and Irian Jaya are the theatre cause great sufferings with the population.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow, we will give the Sakharov Price.</seg>
<seg>The breaking news emanating of the Indonesian archipelago obliges us however to ask to us whether the situation of president Wahid and his faithful is not yet more serious, more critical than the analysis of the rapporteur suggests it.</seg>
<seg>If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene now with money and concrete actions, and not only with words.</seg>
<seg>This report/ratio is extremely invaluable because it informs us on development of events.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be solved in one day.</seg>
<seg>Protection of the financial interests of the Community</seg>
<seg>The obstacles with its independence, as well on the level of the recruitment of the personnel as on the level of his structure, must be removed.</seg>
<seg>It is thus essential that by an internal reform process, the Commission embodies finally its will stated not to tolerate any fraud more and to continue them consequently.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it is that which must result from it, and which must also result from Nice.</seg>
<seg>We would like that the Member States start negotiations for the adoption of an uniform legislation in the area of crime, but we refuse that our countries depend on a concerning federal public ministry EU.</seg>
<seg>I would like to also know why the publication of the Commission communication on this subject was deferred to the day following the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg>I presented an amendment aiming at indicating these countries by name, because it is times to say clearly which they are and which they are covered with shame.</seg>
<seg>I am certain that the OLAF considers that it is in his interest to make transparent the choice of his top-ranking executives.</seg>
<seg>However, we must take care, within the European Parliament, not to pass beside the beam which is in our it by concentrating us on the straw which is in it of the neighbor, the Commission.</seg>
<seg>We try to extinguish a fire, but smoke makes us suffocate.</seg>
<seg>Nobody can include/understand it, me either.</seg>
<seg>For seizing this matter well, I would allow myself to put forward four points which I consider fundamental in the work of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>As for the Parliament itself, its problem is the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>It is rather worrying besides, Madam the Police chief, that the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - must be explicitly recalled to the order with regard to the respect for the rights of the deputies.</seg>
<seg>The latter can for example recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations intended for the budget lines concerned in the budget for the year following, or not to authorize any transfer of appropriations since it is a question of increasing the budget lines concerned and that, until the end of the internal investigations in progress. It can go until asking that the president of the Commission require the resignation of the police chiefs concerned with the serious problems which were noted, a European Caesarean to some extent.</seg>
<seg>The report/ratio claims detailed inventories of the operational activities, depth studies of the budget lines and irregularities as well as an internal audit of the parliamentary committee.</seg>
<seg>Madam the Police chief, the legal basis relating to the transmission of informations to the European Parliament is the treaty THIS and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg>Without modifications, the final result of this common position would be however an inequality of the weapons not only compared to North America but also in Europe.</seg>
<seg>I really do not see why we would not end here as in all the other cases to a compromise.</seg>
<seg>It is a question of a proposal which traversed a length - and, I fear it - sinuous way, to overcome certain existing difficulties.</seg>
<seg>The first amendment concerns Article 4, which establishes which must be the competent authority for the control of the offer.</seg>
<seg>We find ourselves now with a proposal which would lead to a true mess, a free-for-all with its procession of potential litigations at one delicate time of the negotiation.</seg>
<seg>In the United Kingdom, the regulation of the recoveries, by the means of the voluntary code of practice put in uvre by the commission of the public offerings of purchase, is a true success: here is an excellent example of pragmatic approach of an extremely complex problem where the legislation would be less suitable.</seg>
<seg>But what is even more important, it is that it enables us to make progress the diary of Lisbon aiming to the creation of a competitive and dynamic European economy.</seg>
<seg>The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is finally that the conflicting interests, for example, the directory versus the shareholders, the large shareholders versus the small shareholders, the companies versus the financial market, are regulated in a minimal form at the European level.</seg>
<seg>Certain amendment proposed by the Parliament still make other improvements to the text of the common position of the Council. They indeed put forward points which can give place to interpretation difficulties and insist on a faster transposition of the directive.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, it is absolutely not certain only the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the various definitions used currently in the Member States are enough all amply.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, during one three years period, the artist will have the right to require professionals of the art market any information concerning the amounts which are due for him, which is judicious since they must hold a register of the purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, it is the Austrian legislator who are aimed and not the European legislator who creates only positive framework conditions for the artists and the sale-rooms.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, in the subject which occupies us, the need for a common position is all the more large as only a common position will make it possible the European Union to weigh with the international level so that the interest of the creators can be defended on a world level.</seg>
<seg>I have confidence in the wisdom and the understanding of this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>In Germany, for example, in 1998, out of 7.000 artists having transferred their rights, 274 only finally recovered money, without counting that 40% of the right of continuation passed in recovery costs of the sums due.</seg>
<seg>In short, it is not no need for a harmonization of this kind in the sector concerned.</seg>
<seg>A similar amendment had been rejected in single reading.</seg>
<seg>They thought that the translations could follow in spite of this rather tight and difficult calendar.</seg>
<seg>Only, we arrived at a point such as we cannot differ this debate any more.</seg>
<seg>We proposed within the commission to proceed to it one year earlier.</seg>
<seg>Our Parliament is naturally side of these values and it will not have of cease to defend them.</seg>
<seg>The technological development and the fluctuations of the markets will involve changes in any event.</seg>
<seg>Here, we cannot find justification legal with an exclusion of competition.</seg>
<seg>The limitation of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams is likely to put the national controls of the stations in a delicate situation, in the sense that they will be able with difficulty to offer an universal service at an affordable price with the citizens, independently of their place of residence.</seg>
<seg>I recall to my Conservative colleagues the problems that they had in the United Kingdom when they tested privatiser the British stations.</seg>
<seg>We neither more nor less transformed the safety net of the users of the post office into a hammock in which the large actors of the postal sector can continue vautrer and act with complete freedom.</seg>
<seg>I of it am very satisfied because, nevertheless, this notion of special services claimed to put modern technologies out of the field of the universal service.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mister the Police chief, we cannot tolerate and will not tolerate such a situation.</seg>
<seg>It is well the reason for which the European commission did not propose, like second phase, a total liberalisation of this sector.</seg>
<seg>It is an evolution of this type which I wish in the other States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Misters Bolkestein recently denounced the not very liberal attitude of the French in the Dutch press, it is at least what the title of the article in question announced.</seg>
<seg>On this subject, one could quote Spain, which constituted funds of this type and which uses it, this to speak about the random legal framework on which the funds is based, of the virtual criteria relative to its composition, of the discrétionnaires downstreams of its application.</seg>
<seg>We vote tomorrow: I hope that this vote will have place before the amendment of Misters Atkins or that of Misters Sterckx, without what I will have to vote against this report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>Royal Mail takes part in competition, and distributes my mail to Malmö in Sweden.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, Mister the Police chief, whom did teach us the debate, or rather the polemic caused by the Bolkenstein police chief in his continuation of a liberalisation of postal services, undertaken in the absence of any assessment of the initial step and in violation of the rules defined by this directive? That under cover of progressists terms and developing such as modernization, liberalization, accompaniment of technological rises, one rocks in a regression of the social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg>The safeguard of the universal service using compensation funds which would make it possible to engage of the private profits to the profit of the public service will probably make failure.</seg>
<seg>These limits and these delays also contributed to a debate in which one often confuses the end and the means.</seg>
<seg>One could not evoke this subject, Madam the President, without speaking about economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg>Madam the President, first of all allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Misters Ferber because it actually completed a complex, difficult work and it endeavoured to find a balance between the proposals, positions and completely different starting points and arrival.</seg>
<seg>I fear that this proposal does not reinforce yet the current position of monopolistic with the expenses of the taxpayer and increases the threshold imposed to the newcomers.</seg>
<seg>I also delighted to see that our liberal friends of the continent show the example with the British liberals.</seg>
<seg>Admittedly, I admit that liberalization in oneself is not a problem and that it can prove to be beneficial for the consumers.</seg>
<seg>Justified, because it falls under the logic of the Founding treaties of the European Union, which propose completion of the internal market by the free movement of the goods and the services in an competitive environment.</seg>
<seg>The universal service is the angular stone of the Community policy in this field and all that we make aims at creating a favorable climate to improve it.</seg>
<seg>The special services also constitute a sector where the innovation and modernization must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg>According to him, by the end of the decade, the opening to the competition of the near total of the postal market seems inevitable.</seg>
<seg>I think that it is necessary reliable guarantee in order to permanently preserve the universal service and its obligations.</seg>
<seg>This is why I cannot and will not remain quiet whereas the future of the sector is threatened by a possible decision which would result in not to answer as it should be the challenges which were launched to us to all to Lisbon.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg>However, I point out that this common market organization has as main objective the guaranteed access at the Community market of its productions.</seg>
<seg>I am happy that we still could arrive to a unanimous vote within the Committee on Agriculture. I thank for them my colleagues like Misters Fernández Martín, rapporteur for the Committee of the development and the co-operation, for his support.</seg>
<seg>We cannot prevent ourselves from expressing our concern for the banana productions of certain ACP countries, of the producing tiny countries of the Antilles and some countries of Western Africa which are traditional suppliers of the banana market and with which we pledged that we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, I wish that this report/ratio be constant as a whole by the members of this Parliament, as it was the case at the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, the United States condemns the historical reference periods initially but preaches their own historical reference periods now.</seg>
<seg>Powerful interests come into play, in particular those of American, who is not themselves of the banana producers, but which dissimulated the American capital in the commercial enterprises.</seg>
<seg>It seems sometimes that the Commission, in the proposals for a deregulation of the trade and the agricultural production with international scales, further goes than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg>It's a pity that the Commission and the Council persist in a solution likely to compromise this production seriously, in particular after 2006.</seg>
<seg>The successive decisions of OMC do not say that it is to us interdict to grant a preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg>Thus, the transitional period should be approximately fifteen years and in no case lower than ten years; compensatory aids must include the guarantee of the incomes of the Community producers and the flow of the production of the outermost regions. It is also necessary to include a help with the entities which market the bananas which are produced there.</seg>
<seg>I hope that she will hear our arguments today, because this proposed system by the Commission, this tariff preference, was it of 300 euros, is likely to prove quite useless in the facts because the ACP producers will be rolled by the system known as of the “arrived first, been useful first”.</seg>
<seg>VOTES</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament approves the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg>The Commission refuses the other amendments.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote:</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament accepts the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio (A5-0376/2000) of Mrs. Morgan, in the name of the budgetary Control Committee, on the budgetary reform of the procedures and the audit institutions (2000/2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg>The majority of the smokers do not know all the risks and do not support the real price of their choice.</seg>
<seg>I was always held some with this principle during my 35 years parliamentary long career.</seg>
<seg>I fear that their hopes are vain.</seg>
<seg>It is a question of our ultimate attempt of putting on the cigarette packets of the labels and the images which reflect the real dangers of the tobacco.</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio Lehne (A5-0368/2000)</seg>
<seg>This analysis seems to me at the same time relevant and justified even today, and this is why I voted against this report/ratio in his totality.</seg>
<seg>It is rightly that the Legal Committee persists in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be lower than 7%.</seg>
<seg>To be opposed to this directive is also for my group a means of giving a clear political signal: we should not waste our time to create in Europe of the useless rules.</seg>
<seg>If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of antan, how can one grant least confidence to Misters Putin, the torturer of Chechen people, the godfather of different the Maffias, that which endeavours to liquidate all the oppositions, the civil society (trade unions, political parties), in order to reinforce his personal capacity?</seg>
<seg>Admittedly, Indonesia hardly deserves such a development of the relations because one cannot say that, these last years, its leaders were characterized by their democratic great mind and their great merits, but we must take in consideration the Indonesian citizens, and consequently of agreement for this development of the relations and these assistances.</seg>
<seg>The cell will deal only with the criminal acts made by civils servant of the EU.</seg>
<seg>The Theato report/ratio on the fight antifraude makes it possible to discover that the European Central bank, undoubtedly for better proving its famous independence, did not judge good to adhere to the agreement on the Office of fight antifraude (OLAF).</seg>
<seg>This concludes voting time.</seg>
<seg>Either we belong to the club, or let us not be we and we thus should be folded with this decision.</seg>
<seg>It is not thus called at all EEB - Everything drank bananas. Let us not cause, honourable Members, a change of name.</seg>
<seg>The only tariff system is however an essential element which takes care of the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important base which must make it possible the Council to progress.</seg>
<seg>There in addition exist measurements for the marking of these bananas in the national plans and regional of promotion of rural development.</seg>
<seg>Europe and the United States work narrowly with the defense of the values which we share.</seg>
<seg>We think of discussing a new cycle of OMC as of the implications for this cycle of bilateral commercial numerous initiatives which make the subject of debates in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg>He said, rightly, that the transatlantic relations developed much these ten last years - mainly admittedly on the American side thanks to president Clinton; but I believe that the history will retain that there also was a European contribution to these new relationships - completely fundamental contribution - to the transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and the new Transatlantic agenda adopted under the Spanish presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg>It will be thus important to undertake a reversing and in fact of composing an transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg>I will conclude with the Dominican Republic which declared: “OMC was supposed to be an impartial referee applying of the common rules and where the various countries could learn how to play the game.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, even if one can be delighted by the retreat of communist imposture, the collapse of the Soviet Union left only one super power: the United States of America.</seg>
<seg>I know that it maintains a constructive dialogue with the Parliament and the commissions which treat these questions.</seg>
<seg>The order of business calls common the following reports/ratios under discussion:</seg>
<seg>These objectives, the secondary primary objective and objectives, will represent the stone of key enabling us to consider the concrete proposals presented by the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that such a solution - the recording in only one country with the possibility of providing services in all the Union - can cause an avalanche in the countries where the tax rate is weak.</seg>
<seg>Thus, an agreement was concluded in 1992, was regarded at the time as a minimum harmonisation, which provided that the standard rate of VAT could not be lower than 15%, the Member States having the possibility of applying one or more reduced taxes not being able to be lower than 5%; exemptions being envisaged in this case.</seg>
<seg>We have call on the European Commission to make sure that there is no market distortion and to submit a report on this subject to the Council and the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>In short, the objective of this proposal is creditable but the method is badly conceived and if we want to really encourage the E-economy of Europe, it would be good to exempt our electronic trade of the VAT rather than to try to impose our problems on the others.</seg>
<seg>If we want to respect the requirement of reduced emission of gas with greenhouse effects, we must take all possible measurements to limit their production.</seg>
<seg>The only case for which no tax is still perceived is that of a delivery in the European Community starting from a third country.</seg>
<seg>Positive discrimination with regard to air transport must cease.</seg>
<seg>The companies of third countries which are not States of the Union are subjected to any taxation.</seg>
<seg>The compact disks are not so antiquated and they would have to be taxed, whereas the programs which would circulate by Internet would be taken the tax off!</seg>
<seg>However, the solution suggested can only appear ingérable technically and make obstacle to the development of the transactions on line in the Union, precisely at the moment when everyone wishes, on the contrary, their expansion.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mesdames and the Deputies, the tax systems of the European Union degrade themselves and lose in output.</seg>
<seg>We should seek to encourage the electronic trade and not new ways of taxing it.</seg>
<seg>The liberals say to us that one needs less possible State.</seg>
<seg>The Primarolo group worked out simple rules that it is necessary to apply.</seg>
<seg>The group that I represent in this Parliament emits however an objection and thinks that it would be necessary to balance the situation between the daily newspapers, which enjoy a VAT rate reduced, and the daily newspapers on line, which do not profit from it.</seg>
<seg>A tax on the kerosene cannot consequently exist that within the framework of an international consensus, in order to guarantee the balance of competition.</seg>
<seg>I greet the fact particularly that the report/ratio underlines one of the key points that I had raised in my report for the Committee of the regional policy, of transport and of tourism, voted by this Parliament a few months ago, namely, that since it is certainly politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the tax on aviation, at least in the short run, should use alternate tools to us to obtain the same effect, including a tax on the emissions.</seg>
<seg>In fact, industry pays 100% of its infrastructure charge via the air traffic control and the royalties of airport, which were assembled to 4 billion dollars in 1998 - contrary to other modes of transport, such as the rail transport or by road, which are still enormously subsidized.</seg>
<seg>The current location is unfavourable.</seg>
<seg>On this subject, force is to note that there exists all the same a problem about the emissions caused by the air traffic. Even if the percentage is not raised so much, it increases significantly and we cannot thus underestimate it.</seg>
<seg>This system would be harmful for SME with the centre and apart from the Union, in particular if one considers the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold at the exaggeratedly low level of 40.000 euros annual sales turnover.</seg>
<seg>If we are too avid with regard to the file with the examination, we really endanger the future of the electronic trade, important for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The principle wanting that the suppliers established outside the Community and returning performances of service with customers inside the Community should not be recorded that in only one place does not have to involve a slip of the tax revenues enter the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Since the discussion is not finished yet within the Council, and waited until the Commission wishes to conclude its file of the VAT and the electronic trade rather quickly, I think that wisest would be not yet not to formally accept the draft amendments formulated by the Parliament but to try to materialize more the maximum possible number of these proposals in the Council negotiations.</seg>
<seg>I cannot thus accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much for all the files which you approached this week.</seg>
<seg>Three months only after the accident, the Commission, as for it, assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament entirely approved last on November 30.</seg>
<seg>With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is, indeed, urgent to standardize the practices and to exert an increased control on the application of the rules Community, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable, within the Union as regards maritime security.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I thank the Police chief for his constant engagement in the field for the maritime security.</seg>
<seg>I make a point of reminding the deputies that as regards air security, the compensations applied in the European framework and the North-American framework are not equivalent to the amounts applied in other countries.</seg>
<seg>In the second place, I would say to you that it is the French justice which could confiscate or freeze the funds of a company to compensate certain damage or others; it is the French justice which could establish responsibilities beyond those envisaged according to the objective criteria for the current international regulation on pollution with hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg>The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the direction of the establishment of a more equitable charging system which also encourages a more rational and effective use of the highway network.</seg>
<seg>Vis-a-vis criticisms, particularly those of Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a new interpretation of it: it would be now about a tax for all the users, including the British drivers of heavy lorries.</seg>
<seg>I am decided to guarantee that the food suggested to the consumers meets the most strict standards, whether it comes from the interior or the outside of the Union.</seg>
<seg>I include/understand the concern of the honourable Member naturally.</seg>
<seg>I am with the regret to say to you, Mister the Police chief, that your answer is not appropriate to me.</seg>
<seg>The remarks of the honourable Member are important.</seg>
<seg>In Nigeria, the All-Ijaw natives showed Chevron to incite with the violence in their opposition and of going until paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot at the demonstrators at the naval base from Warri.</seg>
<seg>In his report/ratio adopted on November 15, the Commission concluded that the assistance with operation granted under payment 1540/98 had not solved the problem of the prices charged by South Korea.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the whole of the intentions is extremely reassuring, but, meanwhile, the fact is that our shipyards are closing their doors.</seg>
<seg>question nº 38 of (H-0868/00):</seg>
<seg>I understand, Mister the Police chief, that you do not wish to modify your decision in spite of the fact that ten Member States be opposed to such customs duties.</seg>
<seg>This initiative rests on a Council Regulation, modifying the payment which defines the current GPS.</seg>
<seg>I represent certain farmers and I thus am very worried.</seg>
<seg>We work there in committee, us did not take it this week, Poul Nielson being absent due to displacement in Balkans.</seg>
<seg>One is working on the safeguard clause and if Misters Clegg needs arguments, to speak with his beet, I hold them at his disposal.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank Misters Liikanen for his answer, which is in all points very positive and appreciable.</seg>
<seg>I will discuss it with my services when the budgetary resources for the next year are defined.</seg>
<seg>Currently, the efforts made by my services and myself aim at limiting the consequences of the distance between the parts and the future court.</seg>
<seg>Following the example courts specialized in the substantive patent law of Düsseldorf, of Munich and other German towns, but also of London, a qualified Community court as regards community patents should be very specialized.</seg>
<seg>In order to prevent that this provisional situation does not take a final character, the Commission, on July 13 of last year, recalled in a letter addressed to the Member States concerned their obligation to indicate which are their competent courts as regards Community marks.</seg>
<seg>As the honourable Member knows it, lodging of a complaint does not have in oneself any influence on progress of the project concerned.</seg>
<seg>question nº 47 of (H-0877/00):</seg>
<seg>That thus means that the Commission does not make use of the legal means which are at its disposal only in the direction heard in the payment.</seg>
<seg>The question is to know to which must address these students to understand that, when they follow this academic cycle and complete it in Great Britain, they have the right to have results.</seg>
<seg>The king, elected for one limited period, could, for example, being chosen among the Finnish European deputies more deserving.</seg>
<seg>That can also be under consideration like a question of competition, since one can continue to net of tax practise sales in the southern part of the Baltic, on the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, while they are prohibited on the line between Umeå and Vasa.</seg>
<seg>We must rectify the situation by stimulating and encouraging the multilingual contents, since it revêt an absolutely crucial character for the success of the European sector of the contents.</seg>
<seg>The problem which worries me more is that the small companies always do not have sufficient guarantees, nor of the commercial antecedents established to offer to the investors.</seg>
<seg>To conclude the ambitious development of this E-content European programme, it is necessary to simplify and make safe the procedures considered.</seg>
<seg>For this reason measurements of public subsidies in favour of the content industry of the EU (their utility was shown) must also tend towards a high level culture and education and towards cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg>In addition, there are the communication networks which need contents to fill their virtual space unceasingly and which regard as self-explanatory to subject the contents, to monopolize them and exploit them without really worrying about the production rules.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I am pleased with the launching of this program - content and would like to draw the attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg>This is why I support the amendments which ask for the adoption of special actions in the field of modern technologies.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, the Commission is delighted by what the Parliament underlines social dimension and cultural digital contents.</seg>
<seg>Evaluation and management of the ambient noise</seg>
<seg>I am indeed grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and besides also part of the liberal group, brought to this concrete amendment, in order to start to limit the noise nuisances caused by the planes.</seg>
<seg>It is only this year, six late years, and insistent pressure of the French government, that the Commission presented its proposal of harmonized noise indicators.</seg>
<seg>It is a moderate proposal. Scandinavia has already standards more strict than those proposed for 2012.</seg>
<seg>Orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and others satisfy strict standards already.</seg>
<seg>Another important point advanced by us and who will be of all his importance within the framework of the problems of the noise emissions due to the planes, relates to the need for laying down additional indices of noise in addition to that mentioned by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>For lack of common standards in the European Union, we attended situations of notorious distortion of competition between airports and lack of equality between the citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg>This is why I find the amendments of my colleague so important Bernd Lange.</seg>
<seg>First of all, I must say that I delighted by this report/ratio.</seg>
<seg>It was the idea of principle which underlay amendment 36, although I think that this idea is not yet sufficiently matured.</seg>
<seg>We should check that carefully and adopt the combined approach on the two plans, i.e. to fix limit values for each emission source on the one hand and on the other hand, to define quality standards for these emissions.</seg>
<seg>It took us more time and I consider it regrettable that we did not have which it, even if, generally, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the Member States provide comparable information, the Commission will take into account the question of the limit values to the Community level, as well as other measurements in order to reduce the number of people affected by the noise and to refer about it to the Council and the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Food additives others that them dyes and sweetening substances</seg>
<seg>Such are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, honourable Member. I feel interdependent of your cause, because if you have a carrot across the throat, I have as for me a cat in the throat, like one says it on our premises, but the influenza runs somewhat here.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, in the event of chronic dietetic problems, the risk of cancer increases.</seg>
<seg>It then also proved that the Commission did not have the suitable instruments to intervene adequately.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow, a new stage appears in the program. Our colleague Marit Paulsen, of the liberal group, will be then in saddle and will on the occasion still to improve the present directive.</seg>
<seg>The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument to guarantee than the Community law as regards animal feeds is correctly applied and to make so that, if crisis situations appear in third countries, rapid reactions are possible.</seg>
<seg>We know that the large majority of Europeans live in the cities and that until now, in fact especially the cities were “the poor relations” on the matter.</seg>
<seg>The planning process must be put in uvre in a way right and innovating.</seg>
<seg>The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable development in urban environment is a suitable instrument to reach that point, just as implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordination and development of actions.</seg>
<seg>The reduction in transport and the abandonment of fossil fuel to the local scales are necessary to arrive to a change from the point of view of the climatic threats which we know today.</seg>
<seg>Many voices suggested that this budget was too reduced.</seg>
<seg>It is expected that the main partners of this framework are the Commission and the networks of local authorities of which the legal responsibility consists to develop and put in uvre policies relating to sustainable development of urban environment.</seg>
<seg>The Court of justice of the Communities and even the settlement body of the conflicts of OMC consider that the precautionary principle finds to apply in environmental field or as regards public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as shows it the pending transaction of cheese to believed milk.</seg>
<seg>The objective should not be a limitation of the damage or its compensation, the primary purpose must be to prevent any harmful effect on health or the goods of the people.</seg>
<seg>Since 1996, the European Parliament had decided in favour of a prohibition of the use of the bone meals in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - so only it had been listened to.</seg>
<seg>An absolute scientific certainty on the new products or substances does not exist and will never exist.</seg>
<seg>To conclude, if the precautionary principle must be put in uvre efficiently and credible, it is vital to utilize all the key actors, including the representatives of civil society, in the political choices which surround its setting in uvre.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, in particular those of economic order.</seg>
<seg>An essential related condition for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concerns as for the possible harmful effects are equipped with a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg>As lately as yesterday, in Lisbon, an American, professor George Carlo, who saw himself entrusting a study on the effect of the waves for the human health by Food and Drugs Administration, revealed that the use of the mobile phones is likely to cause the appearance of cerebral tumours, of the disease of Alzheimer and lesions of the skin.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the environment and the public health are similar with a machine whose complexity is such as it is necessary to supervise and control its multiple functions in order to be able to intervene and avoid thus problems.</seg>
<seg>The application of this principle must avoid at all costs attaching the innovation and the economic activity, generating the frilosity and the industrial opposition to progress, to become a means to divert competition.</seg>
<seg>The Parliament surely noticed that the Commission is of agreement with the majority of the questions raised in motion for resolutions.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place at 10 a.m. tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>Its article 2 sanctions the right to the life. And each time in Spain terrorism kills a person, it is the whole of the European Union which feels concerned in what constitutes one of its most essential principles.</seg>
<seg>Our intention is not to replace the legitimately established institutions, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making concessions with terror.</seg>
<seg>VOTES</seg>
<seg>She also recalled the observation of the Council on the classification of the budget lines on the project of anticipated retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg>(The Parliament adopts the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg>I think that it is not current any more!</seg>
<seg>These last will estimate that the number of 23.428 is insufficient, but they will be however content with the space of growth which is offered to them.</seg>
<seg>This suppression, which started starting from the middle of last year, caused as we feared it a dramatic fall of the rate/rhythm of adoption of projects and implementation of payments, so that the annual execution of the authorizations of this funds was lower than a percent at the end of June 2000.</seg>
<seg>This text is an ideal preferential treatment to close the general secretary of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg>Before my departure, they said to me: “It is Christmas, and us, in Bergamo, we celebrate Christmas and Sainte Lucie.</seg>
<seg>We are especially very criticize with regard to the overproduction of agricultural products and the use of the sources of information of the EU to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I have voting in favour of the report García-Margallo there Marfil, which relates to the tax on the abundant services with electronic way.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I will try, before 2004, to do something for Malta by making a statement in his favour.</seg>
<seg>For as much, I say it with a certain solemnity: it is the maximum which I can accept of Europe, for me, too liberal!</seg>
<seg>The time limit would encourage the stations to develop and modernize still their services and would facilitate planning and the investments on the market.</seg>
<seg>They will continue to put the pressure. The money that they gain with the distribution beyond the limit of the 150 grams makes it possible them to reinforce their position.</seg>
<seg>The liberalisation of postal services suggested by the Commission is neither adequate nor consistent, this is why I voted for the report/ratio and all the tabled amendments which express this same orientation.</seg>
<seg>Report/ratio of Roo (A5-0378/2000)</seg>
<seg>Not being convinced of their compatibility with OMC, we also issue reserves about amendments 17,18,27,30 and 31.</seg>
<seg>A universalization which mistakes the most elementary rights of the human person.</seg>
<seg>That would be contrary with the respect for national identity (article 6, subparagraph 3 of the Union Treaty).</seg>
<seg>It should be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of being there crushed by the globalisation of Internet, found new cultural openness and economic.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, in the absence of other results, the bargainings of Nice will have clarified the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The ton of the joint resolution is, from this point of view, well too unilateral.</seg>
<seg>Delay of the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available in this moment, four days later - watch well the difficulty in clearly writing decisions taken in confusion.</seg>
<seg>The only means in the future of avoiding dangerous conflicts, it is to remain about it with the traditional concept according to which Europe rests on the mutual respect of the national communities.</seg>
<seg>The Summit of Nice concluded Sunday by an agreement which should lead to a draft treaty.</seg>
<seg>The resolution about the Summit of Nice, which has just been voted, does not reflect it.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, I would like to refer to the social policy, on which France misait at the time of the presentation of its presidency, but which ultimately remains a hand full with very little of things, in spite of the declarations of intent and the headings of the documents to the extremely vague and clearly insufficient contents compared to the existing problems and to the enormous dissatisfaction, whose manifestation of the workers in Nice will have been an important expression also.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, nothing changed for the really important topics like the taxes, the taxes, the social policy, asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg>The outstanding fact of the debate on Nice is the image of a treaty finally without father, nor mother, since it is not wire of anybody. The French presidency merged in excuses, rather than to clearly assume the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups, which correspond to the governments of the Member States, multiplied their criticisms.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies decreases by limit always more the right of veto and to give always more capacity to the Parliament of the EU.</seg>
<seg>If one had been able to envisage these consequences at the time of the conclusion of the treaty of Chicago at the time of the year of my birth - 1944 -, no exemption of tax for the fuel and other equipment for planes would have probably been agreed.</seg>
<seg>Not existing risk zero, the scientists or at least the policies must apply the criterion of proportionality, consider the risks dubious and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg>This Parliament however also fought so that this reduction of the funds allocated with the innovative measures is compensated by the use of the framework of flexibilisation, defined in a declaration on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg>Everyone has a role to play. Indeed, we evolve/move in a global market, it is undeniable, and in fact the innovations will make it possible Europe to preserve its place among the large ones of technological development in new industries and, in particular, in information technologies, on the basis of the principle, of course, which they receive the resources sufficient financials and a realistic and relevant support.</seg>
<seg>At the time of the previous speakers, some serious words were pronounced in connection with the budget. 400 million euros constitutes really only one minimum for the financing and it will be necessary, at the time of second half of the exercise, to benefit from the possibilities of supplementary credits offered by the flexibility instrument, as the report/ratio notes it.</seg>
<seg>For my direction, one needs that is accompanied automatically by the loss of the European appreciation, contrary for the conclusion of the report.</seg>
<seg>Like let us know we it all, in the European Union, unemployment concentrates on the least developed from an economic standpoint territories and technological, especially the territories of objective 1. It is necessary thus that the innovative measures are not only one technological, but which they emanate from an explicit will to develop the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg>When I return in my home region, in the east of England, and that I see that absolutely no local authority used the money which it received at the time of the last period, I doubt that we were proof of the effectiveness which we will need in the future to accomodate the new communities.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, my opening words will be to inform Helmuth Markov of my thanks and my congratulations for the presentation constructive, extremely qualified and serious of the draft communication relative to these innovative measures of FEDER over the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg>The energy efficiency and the aspects of the environmental policy are not forgotten in these orientations. They can give place to innovative measures under the third topic, which relates to the regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg>We wish however that the projects are selected at the regional level, like included/understood it well besides Misters Berend in his intervention.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>This is why we ask in this report/ratio and the three supplementary amendments which the Commission multiplies the efforts to impose the international procedure of payment of the litigations of OMC.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that the police chief must show with the industry which it makes all that is in its capacity to answer this external threat which weighs on it.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, of course, we count that, as of on December 18, in group meeting 6 of OECD, arrangement “ships” is examined.</seg>
<seg>But it seems that the finishing line is each time pushed back so that we never reach it.</seg>
<seg>As you all know it, this procedure will take more than six months.</seg>
<seg>For the major corporations as for their political lawyers, to assert less State only means than the State and its finance must be at their exclusive disposal.</seg>
<seg>But there to arrive, so that the process makes it possible to consolidate the shipbuilding industry and employment and to tranquillize the families which depend on it, it is necessary to continue the assistances beyond on December 31, 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there are an unfair competition and dumping practices.</seg>
<seg>The improvement of the competitiveness of the shipyards of the EU is encouraged by the Commission, but vis-a-vis the massive dumping of the price applied by Korea, the possible improvement of the productivity is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg>It moreover stressed that the existence of this mechanism was not to create distortions of competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg>The presence of the nuclear submarine having a damage in water of bay of Algeciras was unfortunately transformed into a diplomatic conflict between a military power nuclear and colonial and a Member State of second zone, according to the last classification of Nice, which does not put forward its rights and is subjected in front of infantile explanations.</seg>
<seg>When, by the means of the medical part diffused in the country of the owner - in other words, by the means of the British press -, one discovered that the disease was serious, instead of changing it center, they changed the qualification of the center.</seg>
<seg>We of course await with interest the answer from the Commission to see whether the objective were achieved.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I would also first of all wish me to express my condolences to the family of the assassinated adviser and with the colleagues of the popular party, and to reject this fascistic cruelty of ETA and the groups which protect it.</seg>
<seg>I also think that it would be appropriate that the Tireless submarine is taken along to the United Kingdom to be repaired, as soon as possible, when the adequate climatic conditions allow it.</seg>
<seg>The Honourable Members asked whether the Commission considered that the directive 89/618/Euratom concerning the information of the population on the applicable protection measures medical and the behavior to be adopted in the event of radiological emergency and the directive 96/29/Euratom setting the basic standards relating to the health protection of the population and the workers against the dangers resulting from ionising radiations applied to the case of the submarine and which measurements had been taken consequently.</seg>
<seg>If it is better lawyer than our advisers, I impatiently wait to hear it. I thus return from there in article 37.</seg>
<seg>An aspect of Euratom Treaty relates to the transportation of radioactive waste of a Member State of the European Union to the other; but, like Gibraltar been part, of course, of the United Kingdom, any transport of waste will be done of part of the United Kingdom to another without crossing another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>It is my opinion. It is enough for him simply to gain the confidence of the people living on the rock.</seg>
<seg>However, we see here a Member State which treats the public opinion of another Member State as it would make it with any State in the world, like if, at the bottom, it did not have null affectio societatis there fifty years after the start of the european company, as if European solidarity had by no means progressed.</seg>
<seg>It is an established fact, that at one time, the only operative submarine in British water was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg>There, one discusses but the citizens, basing themselves on their knowledge and their intuition, direct their attention towards the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that the reduction in the investments in new military equipment related to the restrictions of the military budget decided by the Labor Government will in the future multiply the cases of shrinking of military equipment for basic repair.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, it extends, as opposed to what certain people would wish it, with classification of seaports likely to receive broken down submarines, neither with the technique safety issues of the nuclear reactors nor in the conditions to which a submarine must answer to be sent in repair in another place.</seg>
<seg>It would be necessary, to help them more, ask the Community to reinforce financial resources, human institutions and materials of the HCR.</seg>
<seg>I call on the Commission to increase this help with the HCR again and also to indicate this last like coordinating body in all its contracts with ONG.</seg>
<seg>It must thus be able to have access to the civilian victims and its teams on the ground should be able to spread themselves in full safety and have the necessary resources with the achievement of their mission.</seg>
<seg>On November 22, the Commission adopted a communication on the institution of a common asylum procedure and the granting of an uniform status of valid refugee in all the Union. It is towards this final objective which the European asylum system common definite tightens to Tampere.</seg>
<seg>I will finish while paying tribute to the work that Mrs. Ogata achieved for the HCR and by welcoming Misters Ruud Lubbers at her new station.</seg>
<seg>It seems important to us to encourage a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for the restoration of the democracy, but it seems also important to us to condemn without any doubt the resumption of the incursions and the terrorist activities to the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo because they recall in a worrying way what occurred during the conflict from Kosovo, where western powers were certain responsible.</seg>
<seg>Our compromise resolution is clear in paragraphs 1,2 and 3.</seg>
<seg>I of call also in president Kostunica so that he explains what he is occurred people like Misters Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we are unaware of completely, interests us in the most point.</seg>
<seg>I am also of agreement with the fact of calling upon Kfor in order to avoid any other attempt at violence in the valley of Presevo.</seg>
<seg>I approve the measurements taken now by the KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call all the parts with moderation.</seg>
<seg>B5-0916/2000 of Misters Barón Crespo and others, in the name of group PSE;</seg>
<seg>This clause was agreed with the palate of Moneda in March 1990 and I know it because I had the privilege to be present at the time of the taking possession of president Alwyn, after the plebiscite which put an end to the mode of the Pinochet general.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, my honourable Members, I would like to intervene on the joint resolution that obviously we will vote.</seg>
<seg>Is needed that the international community exerts its right of democratic oversight, not like an interference in the affairs interior of an independent country, but like a political process, careful and preventive.</seg>
<seg>The situation in the prisons and the police stations is completely unacceptable, because in particular of the ill treatments and tortures which are very widespread there.</seg>
<seg>This treatment would be exactly similar to that which one sees in Western Europe and the minister Hikmet Sami Turk, confronted with these protests, differed the transfer, so that a social and political consensus on the reform of the prisons develops in all Turkey.</seg>
<seg>There is urgency and therefore we decided to put this point at the order of business.</seg>
<seg>It passes in lawsuit next on January 8. It is reproached to him for having taken part in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which besides it denies.</seg>
<seg>When the militants and persons in charge of these associations want to meet the anniversary of the Universal day universal of the human rights, their houses are encircled by the police force and those which go there are attacked in the street by men as a civilian.</seg>
<seg>The second problem is at the bottom only one example of the many annoyances.</seg>
<seg>My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the rights situation of the man in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, Mesdames and Sirs, let us keep a little measurement please.</seg>
<seg>The negotiations occurred extremely well, I am magic that we progressed much in these negotiations which, I hope for it, will arrive at the conclusion to which made to reference the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg>Several deputies evoked the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg>B5-0912/2000 of Misters Van Hecke in the name of group PPE-DE;</seg>
<seg>We could not be, I believe, Mr. President, Mister the Police chief, in withdrawal on this attitude.</seg>
<seg>The soldiers seized the power in this context, which, like always, did nothing but worsen the situation.</seg>
<seg>This attitude is well in the continuity of the policy of the French imperialism.</seg>
<seg>The Commission also is very worried by the recent outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg>The debate on topical problems, urgent and of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg>An unfair competition can contribute to degrade the quality of working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce the technical training like generating a loss of jobs and carrying out, later on, with a monopoly situation, which would be prejudicial for the world trade.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the official report of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg>This is why I thank all my colleagues for the contribution which they made, in particular at the time of the stage of the amendments, as well as the technicians of the commission of which invaluable assistance with licence to finalize this resolution.</seg>
<seg>The adoption of the social agenda by the European Council of Nice satisfies us highly and we hope that the Member States will seize this occasion to promote the development and the coordination of the social security systems and care intended for the elderly and to also promote other measurements which will ensure the reintegration in the working life, like the east the training throughout the life.</seg>
<seg>The promotion of the training throughout the life - a subject already tackled by another speaker - is a subject which I also support.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the people of more than 60 or 70 years can still make many useful things, but it is not normal to make depend their labor incomes which they provide.</seg>
<seg>In its monthly bulletin of July 2000, the European Central bank launched several urgent warnings besides on this subject.</seg>
<seg>For my part, I estimate that the Member States are more capable to regulate this problem by the means of their legislative instruments.</seg>
<seg>With its proposals for a working life during old age, the company gains a whole generation.</seg>
<seg>The promises concerning the retirements must be held, the pensions having however to be assured by the funds these countries without their payment being done with the detriment of the policy monetary policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg>We lived the most important of the social revolutions during the 100 to 150 last years, when our life expectancy doubled.</seg>
<seg>It only gives all its direction to the mathematical lengthening of the life which medical progress allowed.</seg>
<seg>They were made subsidize - all the company thus took share there -, of the older employees left their employment but no young worker was engaged and much of stations were removed.</seg>
<seg>The family policy and tax should quite to the contrary make so that the women and the men who have family obligations can or not decide freely to have an community activity.</seg>
<seg>My brother and me joined over there.</seg>
<seg>The next initiatives in the field of the public health are addressed rather to health issues and care for the elderly and to the promotion of a healthy old age.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, I accepted the amendment presented by Misters Pronk, as well the 2 as the 3, in whom he asks that the text be modified and insists on the concept of development demographic, rather than of ageing population.</seg>
<seg>It does not make dual employment with the advertising or promotional operations of the operators of the dies nor with those of the public authorities.</seg>
<seg>Mr. President, the Committee on Budgets was it also of opinion that it is, in theory, favorable to the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg>This is why it is very important to arrive at a balance which could be reached by promotional measures of the outlets and publicity.</seg>
<seg>I think that with regard to marketing and the sale, the training as a framing for the life should be placed at the center of the programs of teaching because precisely modern technologies, the management of the search for outlets offer completely new possibilities to a modern logistics.</seg>
<seg>First of all, I would like to congratulate Misters Dary for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg>The following point milked with the discussions export intervention.</seg>
<seg>There should not be special premiums and of publicity for the products which are not required.</seg>
<seg>Each one has sufficiently to eat, therefore if we make the promotion of a product that will militate obviously against the consumption of another product.</seg>
<seg>The proposed amendments 18 and 24, first part, by which the times during which the topics and products likely to be proposed will be evaluated, are reduced by three to two years in order to improve the effectiveness of the promotional tools.</seg>
<seg>In the Greek version, Mrs. Juta Haug is introduced as rapporteur to the masculine, implying a man, and Misters Marcuse Ferler as rapporteur with female, implying a woman.</seg>
<seg>It is an fine example in the way in which small changes in practice can have important effects.</seg>
<seg>It is temporarily last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of presence of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>In addition, I would like to wish with all, and in particular with some which took the trouble to assist, this Friday, with this last meeting of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, of Happy Christmas and a new century which is good, but especially wise.</seg>
